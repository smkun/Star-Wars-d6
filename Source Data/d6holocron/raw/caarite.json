Because of their native habitat, the species was well-suited for surviving in hot climates. Since extreme cold was unknown to this species, their ability to survive in such environments was hindered more than most species. <br />\n<br />\n'''Personality:''' <br />\nThey were typically sly, ingratiating beings with an eye for profit. Their penchant for crooked business dealings was regularly cloaked by their friendly demeanor. This caused them to suffer from a poor reputation though, making outsider trust of the species a rare thing. When dealing with large groups of individuals directly, their charm was often described as \"child-like,\" exemplifying their guise of innocence. They were often described as \"friendly, entertaining, and humorous.\" \n\nEvery Caarite knew the native Caarimala language, Galactic Basic, and at least one other language. Communication was considered a fundamental skill for their society. This was especially true as the species favors nonviolent means of dealing with an adversary in a face-to-face encounter. Caarites were occasionally Force Sensitive, though their inherent greed prevented them from truly embracing the ways of the Jedi. <br />\n<br />\n'''History:''' <br />\nThe Caarites were members of the Trade Federation. When the Federation blockaded [[Naboo]], the Caarites were convinced it would cause the end of the Federation, so convinced the [[Filordi]] to split off with them in forming the [[Metatheran Cartel]]. Of the two member species of the Cartel, the Caarites served as the public face. \n\nAs the Caarites were well-known in the [[Cularin system]], the alien ever-smiling crew of the local Dorumaa Resort were jokingly known as \"Neo-Caarites\", even though they were Gungans, Humans and Twi'leks. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Average Caarite:''''' Dexterity 2D, Knowledge 2D, Mechanical 2D, Perception 2D+1, Strength 1D+2, Technical 2D. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 1D+1/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 1D+1/4D<br />MECHANICAL 1D/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D+1<br />STRENGTH 1D/3D+2<br />TECHNICAL 1D+1/4D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Climate Resistance/Susceptibility:'' Caarites have adapted well to hot and humid climates, gaining a +2 pip bonus all Strength and Stamina skill rolls made to resist the detrimental effects of such environments. They do not fare well in frigid environments, and suffer a –2 pip penalty to the same sorts of rolls when in cold climates. <br />\n<br />\n'''Story Factors:''' <br />\n''Greedy:'' Although Caarites are outwardly friendly, humorous, and entertaining, they are obsessed with gaining the better part of any deal. <br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 6/8 <br />\n'''Size:''' About 1 meter tall <br />\n'''Source:''' Wookieepedia (For the Caarites Description)",
