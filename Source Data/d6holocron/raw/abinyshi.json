They were bipedal, slender beings with long, supple limbs, flat faces, and forked tails. They developed space travel about the same time as the Corellians and Duros, but their technology was not as advanced. Their colonizations were limited to planets near Inysh. The Galactic Empire strip-mined [[Inysh]] for kalonterium, resulting in toxic pollution that so devastated the Abinyshi they were believed extinct. Small numbers did survive in hiding, and some Abinyshi joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Individuals of the race included [[Si Qurr]], [[S'itl Thirr]] and [[Thi'in Lis]]. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 1D+2/4D+1<br />MECHANICAL 1D/3D<br />PERCEPTION 2D+2/4D+2<br />STRENGTH 2D/4D<br />TECHNICAL 1D+1/3D+2<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Prehensile Tail:'' Abinyshi can use their tails as a third arm at -1D their die code.
