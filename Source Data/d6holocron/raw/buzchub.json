The sentients were believed to be native to Harrandarr, a remote planet in the [[Bosph sector]]. The Buzchub enjoyed traveling the galaxy, using mechanical translators to communicate with other species. Shortly after the Battle of [[Endor]], the Buzchub [[Und'l]] worked for sympathizers of the Galactic Empire, although he believed his employers were simply spice shippers. <br />\n<br />\n'''Biology & Appearance:''' <br />\nThe Buzchub were a sentient species covered in dark blue fur. They were stocky and had a wiry strength that was not immediately obvious. Each Buzchub had a round face with two round, lidded eyes; a stubby nose; and a broad mouth. Their vocal chords were physically incapable of speaking Galactic Basic Standard. The Buzchub had a waddling gait, and an individual could grow to 1.5 meters in height.<br />\n<br />\n'''Society & Culture:''' <br />\nThe Buzchub were a relatively peaceful species. They had an affinity for Wookiees, considering them to be their \"long-haired brothers.\" While incapable of speaking Basic, they could understand it, and spacefaring Buzchub utilized mechanical translators that they wore around the neck in order to communicate in the language. Some Buzchub, such as [[Und'l]], spoke with a peculiar rhythm, using short, paired phrases. Buzchub were not overly curious about other species or technology, but they thoroughly enjoyed traveling the galaxy.<br />\n<br />\n'''History:''' <br />\nThe Buzchub were believed to be native to [[Harrandarr]], a planet in the remote [[Bosph sector]] of the [[Outer Rim]] Territories. In the period following the Battle of [[Endor]] of 4 ABY, the Buzchub [[Und'l]] traveled the galaxy. He began working for people he believed to be spice shippers, but who were in fact sympathizers of the Galactic Empire. For these employers, [[Und'l]] made contact with a group of smugglers on the planet [[Roldalna]], arranging for them to ship spice from [[Nigel VI]] to [[Lohopa II]] in exchange for 25,000. In truth, the cargo was lexonite, a deadly poison used by Imperial terrorist groups. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 11D+1<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D<br />MECHANICAL 1D/3D+1<br />PERCEPTION 2D+2/4D+2<br />STRENGTH 2D+1/4D+1<br />TECHNICAL 1D+1/3D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Vocal Chords:'' Like Wookiees, their vocal chords make them incapable of speaking Basic, so the spacefaring ones equip themselves with a translator device.<br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 9/11 <br />\n'''Size:''' Average of 1.5 meters tall <br />\n'''Source:''' Twin Star of Kira (p. 5-9) & Wookieepedia (For the Buzchub Description)",
