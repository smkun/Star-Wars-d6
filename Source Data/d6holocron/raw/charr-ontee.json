They were genetically created by the ancient [[Kathol]] species. They also were capable of exuding a sticky webbing. They were originally created as a race of farmers thousands of years before the Galactic Civil War, but despite their role, they were considered colleagues by the [[Kathol]] themselves. This way of life ended when the Rift Disaster occurred, which nearly destroyed the Charr Ontee. Those that survived served the Darkstryder as it watched over the Lifewell. When the time came for the [[Kathol]] to awaken, the Darkstryder defied its programming and banished the Charr Ontee for opposing it. This made them the eternal enemies of the Darkstryder construct, living far from the creature's fortress on the [[Kathol]] homeworld. This time apart allowed them to develop their own culture and society but they gradually discovered a terrible secret from their origins. They had learned that on a genetic level the species was degenerating, but this did not affect them learning to use the Ta-Ree life energy and they became quite adept in its usage. This made them a force to be reckoned with in the [[Kathol Rift]] and the more powerful of the [[Kathol]] servants. \n\nA group that survived the cataclysm on [[Kathol]] were thrown into a pocket of [[Otherspace]] and over time degenerated into the [[Charon]] species who sought to destroy all life. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 1D/5D<br />KNOWLEDGE 1D/5D<br />MECHANICAL 1D/3D<br />PERCEPTION 3D/5D<br />STRENGTH 2D/5D<br />TECHNICAL 1D/5D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Spinnerets:'' The Charr Onteepossess spinnerets which allow them to produce sticky fibers in which they can trap their opponent (web Strength 4D).\n\n''Claws:'' The two larger of the Charr Ontee’s four arms end in heavy claws which are capable of doing STR+1D+2 damage. <br />\n<br />\n'''Story Factors:''' <br />\n''Arrogance:'' The Charr Ontee are arrogant and haughty, and consider themselves superior to the DarkStryder engineered species of Kathol. They are willing to consider non-engineered species roughly equal to themselves, and are always interested in studying and cultivating new species.\n\n*''Gamemaster Note:'' The Kathol Charr Ontee have 4 fewer attribute dice than their distant cousins, the [[Charon]]. The Charr Ontee have been slowly degenerating for centuries. These Charr Ontee don’t divide themselves into the bio-scientist and warrior classes; they have remained a generalist species. These Charr Ontee have no Void Cult (a development of the [[Charon]]), and actually consider themselves to have a duty to protect other sentient lifeforms, especially bio-engineered species. <br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' 2.0-2.5 meters tall <br />\n'''Source:''' The DarkStryder Campaign – Endgame (pages 29-30) & Wookieepedia (For the Charr Ontee Description)",
