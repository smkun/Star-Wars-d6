They were covered with thick fur, though they also had a dual lung/gill system which enabled them to breathe both air and water. They also had webbing between each digit and flexible, long tails. Balinaka also had excellent vision, and could see in dark conditions. Their diet consisted mostly of fish. \n\nThe Balinaka shared [[Garnib]] with the [[Vernols]]. Their homeworld was extremely cold, with several continents covered by glaciers dozens of meters thick. The Balinaka carved entire underground cities called Sewfes. The Balinaka were also skilled at sculpting ice, a skill which won them fame throughout the galaxy. \n\nBalinaka were encountered often enough by Rebel SpecOps personnel to acquire the nickname \"bears.\" \n\nIn the [[Senex sector]], Balinaka and [[Ossan]] were used as slaves by [[House Vandron]] on [[Karfeddion]] and other worlds.<br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 1D+2/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 1D/3D+1<br />MECHANICAL 1D+2/3D+2<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D<br />STRENGTH 3D/5D<br />TECHNICAL 1D/2D+1<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Water Breathing:'' Balinaka have a dual lung / gill system, so they can breath both air and water with no difficulties.\n\n''Vision:'' Balinaka have excellent vision and can see in darkness with no penalties.\n\n''Claws:'' Do STR+1D damage. <br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 12/15 <br />\n'''Size:''' Up to 4 meters tall at the shoulder <br />\n'''Source:''' Alien Encounters (p. 28) & Wookieepedia (For the Balinaka Description)",
