They resemble bipedal lizards, with prominent snouts, mouthfuls of teeth, and beady eyes, and they have a fiercely independent warrior society. The Chistori are a secretive people, and even the Jedi Archives have no record of their homeworld.  Like many reptilian species, they are cold-blooded, and like the Trandoshans, they gain a natural armor bonus. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 1D+1/3D+1<br />KNOWLEDGE 1D+2/4D<br />MECHANICAL 1D+2/3D+2<br />PERCEPTION 1D+2/3D+2<br />STRENGTH 2D+2/5D<br />TECHNICAL 1D+2/3D+2<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Natural Armor:'' Grants +1 to Strength to resist damage.\n\n''Cold-Blooded:'' The reptilian Chistori are very sensitive to cold climates. If exposed to extreme cold without proper gear, a Chistori immediately suffers a -1D penalty to Perception when rolling initiative.\n\n*Ten minutes of exposure causes a temporary reduction of -1 to all attributes. After 20 minutes of exposure,the individual must make a Difficult stamina roll. Success means the Chistori maintains consciousness and suffers no damage. If the roll fails, the Chistori suffers an additional -1 penalty to all attributes.Further exposure means another stamina roll every 10 minutes; the difficulty increases by +4 each time. If the Chistori’s Strength is reduced to zero, he dies. Once returned to a warm environment, a Chistori that has not already died will fully recover after 30 minutes.<br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' 1.9-2.2 meters tall <br />\n'''Source:'''",
