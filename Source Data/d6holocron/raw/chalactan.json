There were at least four prominent Chalactan Force-sensitives during the waning years of the Galactic Republic: Jedi High Councilor [[Depa Billaba]] who fell to the dark side, Jedi Master Simms, Jedi Knight [[Sar Labooda]], and Padawan [[Klossi Anno]]. Circa 22 BBY, the Chalactans were represented in the Galactic Senate by Senator [[Yudrish Sedran]], who opposed the Military Creation Act after consulting the wisdom of the Chalactan Temple of Illumination. \n\nChalactans were famous for their spiritual order, the Chalactan Adepts. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D<br />MECHANICAL 2D/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D<br />STRENGTH 2D/4D<br />TECHNICAL 2D/4D<br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' 1.5-2.0 Meters Tall <br />\n'''Source:''' Wookieepedia (For the Chalactan Description)",
