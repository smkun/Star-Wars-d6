Coming from [[Arporatal-Lanin]], Arpor-Lans were famous through the galaxy as scouts and trackers. During the last centuries of the Galactic Republic, the Arpor-Lan were slaves to the noble houses ruling the [[Juvex sector]]. Later, some Arpor-Lan became officers of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, such as Lieutenants [[Deeve]] and [[Fraj T'lin]]. <br />\n<br />\n'''Biology & Appearance:''' <br />\nArpor-Lan were sentient Humanoids sharing a general physical outline with Humans: They had two arms and two legs, and continued effort made them hurt. They were known to sweat near their eyes, and they had a versatile enough tongue to manipulate the monitor pads of a breather mask. They were similar enough to Humans to use Human-oriented technology such as a face breather. An Arpor-Lan had hair on the top of the head, like a Human. \n\nHowever, the face showed two important disimilarities. The eyebrows of an Arpor-Lan showed external bones as plaques, and the chin showed stubby horns. Some Arpor-Lan tugged their horns or cleared their throats when nervous. Arpor-Lan were not immune to phobias. <br />\n<br />\n'''Society & Culture:''' <br />\nArpor-Lan's homeworld was [[Arporatal-Lanin]], in the [[Juvex sector]] of the [[Mid Rim]]. The native Arpor-Lan were galaxy-wide famous as hunters, scouts and trackers. \n\nIn times of the Galactic Civil War, Arpor-Lan travelled through the galaxy. A number of them were armed and instinctively drew a blaster when they felt threatened. <br />\n<br />\n'''History:''' <br />\nArpor-Lan were the native species of [[Arporatal-Lanin]], a planet that had not been discovered by the galactic community. Circa 1,000 BBY, the tycoon [[Thul Vandron]] gathered seventeen noble houses of the Core Worlds and took them to a hidden cluster of worlds. These planets were divided in two groups, Senex and Juvex. Arportal-Lanin was in Juvex, an area that was assigned to Houses Carbinol, Hallikeenovich, Kassido, Kellermin, Mekuun, Pilor, Sisemon and Sreethyn. These aristocrats found native species in their worlds, and spent one century bending them using starships and blaster cannons. [[Arporatal-Lanin]] and the other planets in Juvex became property of the aristocrats. \n\nBy 700 BBY, all the native species of [[Juvex]], including the Arpor-Lan, had been enslaved for so long that they deemed freedom an old myth. But by then the Galactic Republic found Senex and Juvex and began a restless relationship with the ruling houses. Republic pilots heard rumors on the slave locals. In 553 BBY, a Republic warlord began to free some of the species in the area. During the Fourth Nantama Synod, the Houses joined the Republic, with Senex and Juvex becoming sectors. \n\nHowever, the Galactic Senate was unhappy with the slaving ways of the Houses, as they were violating the Rights of Sentience. The Houses demanded that they could keep that integral part of their culture. This led to a number of disputes during the following centuries. <br />\n<br />\n'''Arpor-Lan in the Galaxy:''' <br />\nIn 0 ABY, a number of Arpor-Lan had joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Lieutenant [[Fraj T'lin]], an Arpor-Lan, served in the Rebel base on [[Yavin 4]] soon after the Battle of [[Yavin]]. In 2 ABY, the premier scout Lieutenant [[Deeve]] was one of the more famous Arpor-Lan in the Alliance, and he also worked for Alliance Intelligence. During the New Republic, Deeve worked for the Bureau of Scouting and Exploration Services of the New Republic. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D<br />MECHANICAL 2D/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D<br />STRENGTH 2D/4D<br />TECHNICAL 2D/4D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Track:'' Arpor-Lan gain +1D to tracking and search skills. <br />\n<br />\n'''Story Factors:''' <br />\n''Scouts & Trackers:'' They are renowned for their tracking and scouting abilities throughout the galaxy. <br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' 1.6-2.0 meters tall <br />\n'''Source:''' Wookieepedia (For the Arpor-Lan Description)",
