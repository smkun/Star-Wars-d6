Their bodies were sturdy and roughly humanoid, standing on two feet with a tail used for balance. Members of the species used sharp teeth and a spiked tail as natural weapons and hard, green skin as armor. As of 1 ABY, the Anointed People had a feudal society divided into castes, including the working-class Unwashed and the ruling Godlings, all serving a planetary monarch known as the Godking. \n\nThe galactic community believed them to be a primitive and hostile species, based on obsolete scouting reports from the time of the Galactic Republic that portrayed the Anointed People as a non-technological, unsophisticated species that constantly waged civil wars. However, soon after the Battle of [[Yavin]], representatives of the Alliance to Restore the Republic rediscovered the Anointed People and found them to be intelligent and sophisticated, if still not technological. By that point, the Anointed People, mostly under the rule of Godking Tristram, had made important social advances, replacing their constant warring with a sport-like activity. \n\nThe agents of the Alliance tried to convince the Anointed People to join their faction in the Galactic Civil War, but Godking Tristram was reluctant to agree: He had recently been the victim of [[Jayhawk]], a con artist who claimed to be a member of the Alliance. Tristram tested the might and the nature of the aliens before deciding. The Anointed People eventually joined the Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire and fought Imperial stormtroopers when the Empire landed on [[Abonshee]]. <br />\n<br />\n'''Biology & Appearance:''' <br />\nThe self-designated Anointed People were a sentient species that evolved on the planet Abonshee. The Anointed People were reptiles, like many of the animal lifeforms on their planet, and like most reptiles, they lacked hair. Although their precursor species were four-legged, non-shelled, scaled animals, they evolved into anthropoids that walked on two legs—with their long tail providing additional balance. They also evolved strong bones that protected them from bludgeoning damage.\n\nThe Anointed People had natural weapons in the form of a thagomizer—a spiked tail—and that of big, pointed teeth in their narrow, long heads. They had hard, green skin that provided them with a natural armor against physical and, to a lesser extent, energetic damage. Generally stronger and taller than Humans, members of the species ranged in height from 1.5 to 2.5 meters. As a norm, the Anointed People were clumsier and less dexterous than Humans. <br />\n<br />\n'''Society & Culture:''' <br />\n''Hierarchy:'' <br />\nDuring the last years of the Galactic Republic and until at least the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Anointed People lived in a feudal society, primitive by galactic standards. Political power was centralized in the hands of one individual, known as the Godking. This person's subjects belonged to two classes: The Unwashed and the Godlings. The Unwashed were stout serfs and workers, while the Godlings were aristocrats, ruling over a number of Unwashed individuals—mostly through verbose and meaningless speeches—and in turn obeying the Godking's orders. Some Godlings also occupied roles as the Godking's aides. Both groups favored brightly-colored clothing; the Godlings enjoyed expensive scale armor while the Unwashed were permitted to wear only common robes. As of 1 ABY, parts of their grandiose pomp and nobiliary titles were only symbolic remnants of a previous age, lacking any practical value. \n\nThe aristocracy kept the Unwashed content but uneducated, and they were unaware of life on other planets beyond their native [[Abonshee]], a place called \"Masterhome\" by the locals. Consequently, the Unwashed concentrated their leisure time in domestic ventures and entertainment, such as drinking distilled beverages and gambling. In contrast, the Godlings were aware of intelligent life from beyond the stars and understood that it could be a great opportunity for them; at the same time the Godlings were frightened by their limited knowledge of life beyond the stars, including ignorance of the goals and abilities of those aliens. As such, the Godlings were commonly cautious when dealing with alien sentients, directing them to the Godking.\n\nThe Godking dynasties were selected from among the Unwashed families. The Godking was supposed to retain power only as long as he could stop any Godling from overthrowing him. As such, the Godking commonly tried to manipulate ambitious aristocrats into infighting and internal rivalries. <br />\n<br />\n''Technology:'' <br />\nWith a medieval technological level, and no proof of more advanced technology on their planet, the Anointed People were technologically unsophisticated by the standards of spacefaring cultures. They used carts pulled by draft animals and had the usual problems of pre-industrial societies, including poor medical care and a high rate of infant mortality.\n\nWith their limited mechanization, the Anointed People built homes from stone and wood, commonly a one- or two-floor house or farm in a forest clearing. The Godlings lived in small castles, built as military structures and usually surrounded by five-meter high walls and a moat, with a personal guard of fifteen People. The castle was commonly built near some water well or a path crossing, and some two dozen houses surrounded it, forming a town. Individual farms could be beyond the sight of the castle. \n\nThe greatest city of the northern hemisphere, which was the seat of the Godking government, was inhabited by twenty thousand Anointed People, spaced across six square kilometers. The Godking lived in a palace, three times as large as any Godling castle, baroquely decorated with tapestries and full of courtesans and pages. Its guard also tripled the defense complement of any Godling. \n\nFor large engagements, the Anointed People used catapults and ballistas. Typical melee weapons used by the Godlings included broadswords and shields, while the Unwashed had to make do even more primitive clubs. For hunting, some males used only a bag and a spear; with just these tools, they still managing to capture forest-dwelling griffs, whose meat was considered a delicacy. However, none of this gear was enough to deal with the gargantuan local predator known as the eater. Some wealthy males rode the native likka, using reigns tied to the beast's eyelids. \n\nThe Anointed People were known to use gold and jewelry in their treasure, and silver to build the crown of the Godking. <br />\n<br />\n''Customs:'' <br />\nAlthough not technologically sophisticated, the Anointed People had a complex culture. Having previously been a warlike people, they adapted and changed to minimize bloodshed as much as possible—in part, because they considered physical bloodshed to be aesthetically unpleasant, but also because they erroneously believed advanced civilizations, such as a galaxy-spanning ones, would naturally tend to be peaceful. \n\nBy the time of the Galactic Empire, the Anointed People had renounced waging violent civil wars against each other. However, due to their tendency to respect and maintain ancient traditions, the Anointed People evolved this practice by fighting mock battles. Every spring, almost every Godling would recruit his or her vassals, equip them, and go to a neighboring castle. The marching army would then formally challenge the other Godling to battle and wait for that person to arrange his or her own army. The resulting battle used only clubs—no edged weapons—meaning that the strong bones of the Annointed People protected them from permanent damage; the bludgeoning weapons rarely caused real injuries, and any damage inflicted was comparable to what might be expected from a sports match. \n\nEventually, one of the belligerents would surrender or retire. Custom dictated that the losing Godling pay tribute to the victor, commonly sponsoring a three-day fiesta for both armies. The Unwashed particularly enjoyed these events, taking the opportunity to dress in comical clothes, see other lands, meet potential mates and, most of all, thrill at the final jamboree. \n\nThe Anointed People had a language that outsiders could learn using recorded tapes. <br />\n<br />\n'''History:''' <br />\nThe Anointed People evolved on [[Abonshee]], a temperate planet with moderate seasonal variation and abundant and diverse plant and animal life. Located in the Colonies' [[Fakir sector]], the planet was well outside the sector's trade routes. From reptiles with four legs and scales they developed into two-legged humanoids with a spiked tail and natural armor in the form of hard skin and strong bones. Traditionally a bloodthirsty, militaristic species, the Anointed People were frequently involved in armed territorial disputes during their early history. As a consequence, they constructed fortified strongholds, with villages clustering around such structures for protection. Power became centralized in the Godking; however, the position was coveted and so the Godking was almost constantly trying to quell rebellions. \n\nCirca 89 BBY, a scout starship of the Galactic Republic visited [[Abonshee]], met the locals, and received a hostile reception. The explorers recorded their observations of the Anointed People, including their technology level, social structure, and hawkish attitude. Their computer tapes also included a translation program for the local language and a warning for visitors to the planet. \n\nSoon afterward, around 74 BBY, the last real civil war on Abonshee ended, and the practice was replaced with the spring tradition of simulating a war. Around 39 BBY, a crafty individual known as Tristram became the Godking of Abonshee. Initiating a visionary taxation policy and good public relations, Tristram brought unparalleled freedom and prosperity to the world. <br />\n<br />\n'''Anointed People in the Galaxy:''' <br />\nBefore their contact with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Anointed People had little presence outside of [[Abonshee]]. Afterward, the Alliance was happy to accept any individual wanting to join their army. Also from this time on, the Empire took interest in the Anointed People and went to the planetary surface of [[Abonshee]] to fight them. \n\nBeyond that, the Anointed People showed little need to visit other planets or the space between them. The Godlings were uninterested in far away places, and the Unwashed rarely believed in, or cared about, such things even when faced with them directly. <br />\n<br />\n'''Attribute Dice:''' 12D<br />'''DEXTERITY''' 1D/3D<br />'''KNOWLEDGE''' 1D/3D+2<br />'''MECHANICAL''' 1D/3D<br />'''PERCEPTION''' 2D/4D<br />'''STRENGTH''' 2D/4D+2<br />'''TECHNICAL''' 1D/3D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:'''<br />\n''Armored Bodies:'' Anointed People have thick hides, giving them +1D against physical attacks and +2 against energy attacks.<br />\n<br />\n'''Story Factors:''' <br />\n''Primitive:'' The Anointed People are a technologically primitive species and tend to be very unsophisticated. <br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 8/9 <br />\n'''Size:''' 1.5-2.5 meters tall<br />\n\n== Source: ==\nAlien Encounters (p. 23), Classic Campaigns (p. 36-37) & Wookieepedia (For the Anointed People Description)",
