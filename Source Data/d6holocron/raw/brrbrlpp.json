They were often referred to by offworlders as the Cold Ones since it was easier to say than Brrbrlpp. They spoke a form of trinary via radio-waves which was taught to them by Commander Si of the [[Esfandia]] Long-Range Communications Base. The Brrbrlpp as a species were talkative and their calls could travel great distances. Like many other sentient species, Brrbrlpp youth were willing to risk death for excitement. \n\nSince [[Esfandia]] could not support a large and varied ecosystem, the species was never plentiful and during the time of the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] War, it was estimated that there were several thousand Brrbrlpp. On [[Esfandia]], the Brrbrlpp tend massive gardens and bred swarms of flying insects which they traded for trace minerals filtered from the air. <br />\n<br />\n'''Biology & Appearance:''' <br />\nThe Brrbrlpp were flower shaped amoeba like sentients. They rippled the outer edges of their bodies to provide motion and could move rather swiftly if necessary. A ring of photosensors studded its interior, they had radial lines of cilia, semi-transparent flesh and had a complicated skeleton to keep its \"petals\" rigid. Inside its body they had gently pulsating dark patches that could have been internal organs, they also had a long whip-like tail. The females laid eggs and the males would later fertilize them. As a species the Brrbrlpp would breed in caves they called the Nesting Plains, which were deep and located near the warm of Esfandia's core. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D<br />MECHANICAL 2D/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D<br />STRENGTH 2D/4D<br />TECHNICAL 2D/4D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n*None Known <br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' Medium <br />\n'''Source:''' Wookieepedia (For the Brrbrlpp Description)",
