Around 22 BBY, shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Moonseeker reached the rank of Jedi Knight after training under Jedi Master [[Va'too]]. Four months after her promotion, Moonseeker fought in the First Battle of [[Geonosis]], during which her former Master was killed, while the Argauun survived; the outcome compelled Moonseeker to hang her head in shame. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D<br />MECHANICAL 2D/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D<br />STRENGTH 2D/4D<br />TECHNICAL 2D/4D<br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' 1.6-1.9 meters tall <br />\n'''Source:''' Wookieepedia (For the Argauun Description)",
