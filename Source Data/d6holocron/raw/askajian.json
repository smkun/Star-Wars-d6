Externally, they appeared very similar to Humans, mainly differing in the thick, wrinkled skin on their forehead, their six breasts, and their girth. Internally, the Askajians were adapted to desert survival with large epidermal sacs for water storage. This allowed them to go for several weeks without water. An Askajian could shed up to sixty percent of the water in his or her body with no effect other than tremendous slimming. Askajians also had two hearts.\n\nAskajians lived in a primitive, tribal society, living mostly by gathering plants and hunting herds of large, woolly beasts called tomuons. One of the most important figures in an Askajian tribe was the weaver, who knew the secret techniques to create tomoun cloth. Tomoun cloth was a strong, yet soft and wrinkle-resistant fabric which was a high-demand luxury item as far away as the Core Worlds. As this was the only export the Askajians had, their tribes had been known to fight wars over the services of especially skilled weavers. \n\nThe main political organizations among the Askajians were nomadic tribes composed of several extended families. These tribes were led by male or female herediary chieftains, depending on the region. Many tribes were formed loose military alliances with one another in order to make war on other tribal federations. \n\nDancers were also important in Askajian culture. A skilled dancer acted as a shaman and loremaster, re-enacting tribal history and legend and leading worship of their main goddess, the Moon Lady. One of the most famous Askajians in galactic history was [[Yarna d'al' Gargan]], who was one of Jabba's favorite dancers in his Palace. When she had stored as much water as she could hold, [[Yarna]] was said to remind Jabba of his mother. <br />\n<br />\n'''History:''' <br />\nDuring the early years of the New Republic, several Askajian tribes migrated to [[Tatooine]] with the assistance of an Imperial defector, [[Gwend]]. They brought with them tomoun cloth to trade for the technology needed to survive on the planet. \n\nIn 8 ABY a tribe of Askajians led by [[Borno]] helped [[Han Solo]], [[Leia Organa Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[C-3PO]], and three [[Squib]] companions evade capture by [[Imperial Stormtroopers]]. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 1D/3D<br />KNOWLEDGE 1D+2/4D<br />MECHANICAL 2D+1/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/5D<br />STRENGTH 1D/2D<br />TECHNICAL 2D/5D<br />\n<br />\n'''Special Abilities:''' <br />\n''Water Storage:'' Askajians can effectively store water in their bodies.
