A Jedi task force engaged and killed them, with the Jedi Knight [[Minch]] killing their leader on [[Dagobah]]. \n\nDuring the Clone Wars, another group of Bpfasshi Dark Jedi were responsible for a rampage of terror and destruction throughout the [[Sluis sector]]. A Jedi task force led by [[Yoda]] was sent to stop them and quell the insurrection in the [[Bpfassh system]]. [[Yoda]] pursued and killed one of the Dark Jedi that had kidnapped smuggler [[Jorj Car'das]]. The Bpfasshi held a strong dislike for all Jedi since that episode. \n\nDespite this earlier hostility, the Bpfasshi joined the New Republic. <br />\n<br />\n'''''Attribute Dice:''''' 12D<br />DEXTERITY 2D/4D<br />KNOWLEDGE 2D/4D<br />MECHANICAL 2D/4D<br />PERCEPTION 2D/4D<br />STRENGTH 2D/4D<br />TECHNICAL 2D/4D<br />\n<br />\n'''Move:''' 10/12 <br />\n'''Size:''' 1.5-2.0 meters tall <br />\n'''Source:''' Wookieepedia (For the Bpfasshi Description)",
