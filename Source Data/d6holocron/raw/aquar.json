The Aquar were an offshoot of Humans who colonized [[Velusia]] thousands of years ago and evolved into their present form. An Aquar typically had blue or green skin covered in fine scales, with partially webbed fingers and toes, green hair, and large eyes. Aquar noses were flat, with gill-like horizontal slits in place of nostrils. \n\nThey lived a peaceful life of subsistence on [[Velusia]], harvesting fish and plants from the oceans and raising herd animals on the few above-water mountains. \n\nWhen scouts from the [[Nexcore Mining Corporation]] arrived on [[Velusia]], they assumed the Aquar were natives and used them as cheap labor and supplanted their culture. <br />\n<br />\n'''Personality:''' <br />\nAquar live peaceful lives of subsistence on [[Velusia]], harvesting fish and plants from the oceans and raising herd animals on the few above-water mountains. <br />\n<br />\n'''Physical Description:''' <br />\nAn Aquar typically had blue or green skin covered in fine scales, with partially webbed fingers and toes, green hair, and large eyes.
