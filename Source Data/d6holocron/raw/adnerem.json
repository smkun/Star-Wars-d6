They had large, triangular heads with wide eyes and a large knob in the center of the forehead. Their thin arms each ended in four talons with no opposable thumb. Adnerem were not gregarious, preferring small families known as steri (singular, steris) whom dwelt together in steri-houses. The members of a steris were known as sterisi. Individual couples often formed a close friendship known as a sterika. Two steri often engaged in a battle for balance of power known as a raid-war. Despite the race's anti-social tendencies, their homeworld was a tourist trap with over 2,000 theme parks and casinos. Individuals of the race included Etsero. \n\nOne Adnerem mercenary, and acquaintance of Colonel [[Quaal Tavier Catharius]], became a member of [[m'Yalfor'ac Order]] four-person leading committee and one of the two only non-Bitthævrians in all the Order. <br />\n<br />\n'''Attribute Dice''': 12D<br />'''DEXTERITY '''1D/3D<br />'''KNOWLEDGE '''1D+2/4D+2<br />'''MECHANICAL '''1D/3D<br />'''PERCEPTION '''1D+2/4D+2<br />'''STRENGTH '''1D/3D<br />'''TECHNICAL '''1D/2D <br />\n<br />\n'''Story Factors:'''<br />\n''Behind the Scenes'': Adnerem like to manage affairs behind the scenes, and are seldom encountered as “front ofﬁce personnel.”<br />\n<br />\n'''Move''': 10/11<br />\n'''Size''': 1.8 - 2.2 meters tall<br />\n'''Source''': Alien Encounters (p. 19) & Wookieepedia (For the Adnerem description)",
