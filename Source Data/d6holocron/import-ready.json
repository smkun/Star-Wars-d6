They had long bodies that moved low to the ground on rows of small \"legs\". Their dorsal side was lined with heat-dissipating flaps and olfactory stalks. Beneath each flap was a small mouth that caught tiny creatures attracted to the flap's heat. Each end of the Aganof body ended in a jointed limb tipped with a sharp claw. Blind and deaf, Aganof relied on vibrations and scents for communication. Aganof were hermaphroditic: all Agonof could lay fertilized eggs in the spawning caves. While highly intellectual and philosophical, they knew little of the galaxy beyond their caves, and had little in the way of contact with the surface-dwelling Pulras and Hairy Savages. They considered infectious moss a delicacy, and there was the possibility that an infected humanoid could persuade the Aganof to eat the moss off their bodies. Special Skills: Vibration Detection: Aganof use this skill to detect ground vibrations and determine the proximity of creatures and beings around them. The difﬁculty depends on the distance and type of vibration: They can also detect air vibrations, such as temperature change and movement, and thus can sometimes detect approaching ﬂying creatures, or even sense incoming projectiles and dodge them. Aganof also use their hard shells and this skill for “speech” through ground vibrations, as naturally as humans use their mouths and sense of hearing for speech.",

      "name": "Anzat",
      "plural": "Anzats",
      "description": "Anzat The Anzati (singular: Anzat) were a dangerous and mysterious Force-sensitive near-Human species with two tentacle-like proboscises that curled out and extended from their cheeks, with which the Anzati were able to feed upon the brains of their prey. With the tentacles retracted into seams along each side of their nose, Anzati were indistinguishable from any other humanoid species in the galaxy. They were an extremely long-lived species, also possessing regenerative capabilities beyond those of the average humanoid. The Anzati were also telepathic, growing more adept at the talent as they aged, allowing them to dominate someone's mind to give them a chance to feed. According to the Jedi Master Zao, the soup that Anzati drank was the future, and thus, the Force. Because of this, Anzati who drank the soup of another Force-sensitive would strengthen his connection to the Force. Biology & Appearance: The Anzati were Human in appearance, with bulbous noses, flared nostrils, and grayish-hued skin. Their height ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 meters. Scientists and xenobiologists had little opportunity to study the Anzati, but sketchy medical reports found on the species indicated that they had no natural biorhythm; that is to say, no pulse, and as a result, no body heat. Therefore, it was a total mystery as to how their circulatory system functioned. The youngest Anzati were ancient. The ages of the eldest could be measured in eons. They roamed the galaxy when the Galactic Republic was just a dream of the Core Worlds. The Anzati could live for millennia, sustained by the life essence they drew from others. An Anzat who did not feed at least once every few days merely grew hungry. Lack of sufficient meals had no more of a supernatural aging effect on an Anzat than it did on a Human. Because the Anzati preyed upon those whose life force was strong, they must be stronger. While Anzati tended to possess exceptional might and often startling reflexes, they were not supernaturally endowed. At best, they reflected the pinnacle of Human athletic ability; at worst, they merely had the attributes of an ordinary Human. However, physical strength was only a small part of the equation. To sense the presence of a strong life essence in others, they had highly developed sensory organs unknown in other sentient species. To physically drain this life essence's connection from living beings, they had to be physically adapted to do so. For the Anzati, these things were interconnected. The Anzati were natural predators, preferring to hunt sentient races of every shape, size and species. To this end, they possessed two long, prehensile proboscises similar in appearance to tentacles. They kept these proboscises coiled in their twin cheek pockets for feeding on unsuspecting victims; when their proboscises were retracted, they were practically indistinguishable from Humans. They fed in a unique way that was described as grotesque. Using a kind of mind control, which Jedi who had encountered them claimed was akin to Force manipulation, they bewitched their victims in a manner similar to a Jedi mind trick. Using this telepathy, the Anzat lured in their unsuspecting targets by mesmerizing them with their telepathic control. This control strengthened at close range and was even further augmented and honed with age and use. Once a victim was within their power, the Anzati would uncoil their thin proboscises from their cheek pouches located on either side of its nose and usually inserted them into the subject's nostrils and into the cranium, where the brain was sucked out of the organism, though the Anzati fed by drawing soup out of wherever it resided in a victim, as it varied by species. In most humanoid races, it lay within the brain cavity. Almost of their own, the proboscises sought the victim's soup, and began draining it into the Anzat. The victim could struggle, though often the Anzat's attack was so sudden, so perfect, that it was too late. This action, however, required time and could not be rushed. This behavior led to the nickname of \"snot vampires.\" They also had been known to grasp the victim's head to hold it in place close to them as they fed. They called this meal \"soup,\" \"luck,\" or the \"Sea of Memory.\" The actual substance they drained out of living beings—the gelid, mucoid medium for the luck or life essence—they referred to as soup. In Anzati traditions, the term referred to the life essence, or spiritual power, of the victim. As well, the Anzati believed that this life essence governed a living being's personal presence. Thus, the more presence a victim had, the more potent the luck was likely to be. Particularly fortunate individuals were tasty meals for the Anzati. It was reputed that Anzati could keep their victims alive for several feedings, taking great pleasure in the fear and terror they felt throughout the ordeal. Though life essence and luck were manifestations of the Force, the luck upon which Anzati fed was only peripherally related. Certainly, beings who were particularly gifted in the Force were appetizing to an Anzat, but this was usually because their close connections with the life energy of the universe presented the appearance of a great personal presence. Of course, experienced Jedi usually had both powerful personal life essence and a close connection with the universe's through the Force. The Anzat who made a meal of such a Jedi was a rare and terrible creature indeed. The Anzati, of course, considered such discussions academic. \"The Force\" was a concept developed by younger species. It was a concept Anzati do not recognize as any more correct than any of a dozen theories before. They knew only that weak-willed beings were as unsatisfying as table scraps. To subsist on the average sentient, an Anzat would have to feed on a dozen beings every day; and since the meal rarely survived the feast, the Anzat would leave a trail of corpses. On a world without sentient beings, or in a place where soup is in short supply, an Anzat could easily starve to death. Most of the galaxy, however, was unfortunate in this regard: the Anzati were not liable to die off so easily—sentient beings were plentiful enough to feed a legion of them. Despite myths to the contrary, victims of the Anzati did not become Anzati themselves. Society & Culture: The drive to hunt for \"soup\" seemed to be the central factor of Anzati life; one could almost have considered them an addicted people. Once they began the hunt, they thought of nothing else but to satisfy this hunger, a hunger that grew stronger and more powerful with each passing year. Anzati were reported to view all other peoples as livestock to be harvested to fulfill their needs, although some were known to try and stave off the craving for as long as possible between feedings. Anzati were known to be creatures of a single-minded purpose, they spent their long lives surviving from one meal to the next—in the process, depriving living beings of their own lives. Either way, because the hunger grew as they aged, and they lived for such a long time, they ended up becoming more and more isolated in their need. The older the Anzati, the more unstable and obsessive they became, often to the point of insanity. They would lose focus on the world around them and in many cases would make a crucial mistake, leading to their ultimate destruction. Some Anzati believed that feeding on live vessels gave them eternal youth and energy. This belief can be traced to the Silent Voices, luminescent bands of gases that glowed in the Anzat atmosphere at night. Ancient Anzati believed that these were the life essences of their ancestors. Although such a possibility was not scientifically viable, it illustrated the level of importance that \"soup\" played in Anzati culture, morals, and belief structures. Anzati reproduced infrequently, and usually lived for many centuries. Parents did not typically give their children names, instead allowing them to seek names that best blended in with their chosen prey. Youthful Anzati reached puberty at approximately one hundred standard years of age, and, when that time came, they left Anzat to hunt for \"soup\" and continue their so-called eternal existence. Though it was easy to picture the Anzati as heartless predators, that was no more true of them than it was of any species that ate another species to live. With their long lives, Anzati had plenty of time to develop and pursue all manner of interests; many were devoted patrons of the arts. A few had even produced works of art of their own: books, music, paintings, sculpture, films, and holos. Few had created more than one example in any given medium, however. For a being so long-lived as an Anzat, perfection at a craft was pointless; reaching the pinnacle of an art was no real accomplishment if its only other practitioners died off a thousand years ago. A common misconception among those who studied tales of the Anzati was that they were hyper-developed scholars, experts in fields of knowledge and craft long since forgotten by younger species. While Anzati could remember things that happened centuries earlier, they had little or no interest in pursuing mastery of any given area of expertise or knowledge—other than feeding. To the Anzati, the important skills to pass on to their offspring were the arts of stealth and the kill; everything else was just amusing diversion, hardly worth the effort of committing to memory. The Anzati were accomplished hunters, tracking their quarry silently, invisibly and efficiently. Their abilities served them in avoiding notice as well. Despite occasional noticeable individuals, all Anzati diligently maintained as low a profile as possible, disappearing into the galaxy's crowds as soon as anyone appeared to notice their activities, abilities, or longevity. An Anzat used his or her sense of personal presence to hunt—to detect prey's soup. The stronger the target's soup, the more the target stood out to the Anzat's senses. Anzati were also difficult to capture. Because of their secrecy, hunting skills, and training, Anzati were often employed by organized crime factions as assassins. The Anzati simply dwelled among the sentient species of the galaxy, blending into the dizzying myriad of cultures—invisible because, until one revealed its true nature to a victim, an Anzat was just another alien; and, of course, once the victim saw the Anzat, it was too late to warn anyone else. Their anonymity was frequently used to their advantage, so they rarely, if ever, worked in groups. It was only in the capacity of a bounty hunter that they would abandon their lonely tendencies and band together to form a corporation or guild. On these exceptionally rare occasions, they would sometimes share prey and the financial rewards of their hunts. These corporations were temporary, often existing for only one hunt, as they typically ended up killing each other to eliminate competition for a very \"soupy\" victim. Thousands of worlds across the galaxy had legends of the Anzati, yet no culture's myths included their origin. To some, this implied that the Anzati had been around longer than any other species, or that they survived, by thousands of centuries, the only other species to share their homeworld. Others believed that the Anzati evolved simultaneously with Humankind, somewhere beyond the knowledge of sentient races, only to enter galactic society at large when hyperspace exploration put the Anzati homeworld within reach of the Republic. When the planet was later found, it was usually avoided for the race's tendencies. History: Because Anzati were roamers, they were often considered mythical and to be nothing but the things of dark legends and folktales. For a long period of time the true location of their homeworld, Anzat, was a mystery. Scientists and explorers who traveled to the world reputed to be Anzat simply disappeared without a trace. There were some reports that placed it in the Mid Rim, near the Perlemian Trade Route. The Anzati were believed to be one of the first spacefaring races. According to anecdotal evidence offered by sentients fortunate enough to survive their encounters with Anzati, the race roamed and wandered the galaxy, returning to Anzat only to find a mate and reproduce and, in some cases, train with Anzati master assassins. It was believed that the Anzati encountered the ancient Sith species during the pre-Republic era, and it was from the Anzati that the Sith drew such practices as dining on bloodsoup on their homeworld of Korriban. Although the Anzati as a species were isolationists, there were several instances in which they were propelled into the galactic spotlight. The earliest known instance was the anomaly of the Jedi Anzat Volfe Karkko. It was rare for an Anzat to become a Jedi because it was believed that Anzati were of too violent a nature to be entrusted with such power as the Jedi wielded, and would not be able to resist using their power to drink the \"soup\" of those around them. With Karkko, this belief proved true, as he had been so well trained that he believed himself above the instinct shared by his species, having never tasted \"soup.\" Unfortunately, this same arrogance led Karkko to think that he could control his inbred nature, and he fed. This mistake in turn resulted in Karkko succumbing to the dark side of the Force. Karkko was captured and held in a stasis field for a millennium on the prison world of Kiffex. During his imprisonment, however, his mind remained active, originally so he could contemplate his actions. Unfortunately, he used this to his advantage, using it to draw numerous followers. Over time, his legend grew among the Anzati on Kiffex, who worshiped him as \"the Dreamer,\" converting his resting place into a sacred temple. Karkko fed his follower's baser instincts, turning them feral and causing them to prey on the residents of inmates of Kiffex with a ferocity that was striking even for an Anzat. Karkko was eventually killed by Quinlan Vos, thus ending his reign there. Nikkos Tyris was another fallen Anzat Jedi who was trained as one of Count Dooku's Dark Acolytes. It was he who founded a competing order of Force-users during the Clone Wars as the first Saarai-kaar of the Jensaarai. Fortunately, the Jensaarai did not pose significant harm to others, never rising to influence much beyond their homeworld and only seeking to serve as protectors. Because the first Jensaarai disciples had not yet been corrupted by the dark side and Sith training, those who followed in fact served the light side of the Force, despite their reverence for Sith traditions. Saljé Tasha, Akku Seii, and Rath Kelkko were three Anzati assassins who were involved with the Jedi in some way during the Clone Wars. Tasha, a female Anzat, was responsible for the death of Finis Valorum, and she and Kelkko were hired by Sora Bulq to train Morgukai warriors on Saleucami. Oppo Rancisis was later assassinated with the help of Rath Kelkko. When Bulq hired the Anzati to train the Morgukai clones, it left a shortage of assassin masters on Anzat, forcing Akku Seii to break tradition and train many Anzati at once. Because Akku was an acquaintance of Jedi Master Tholme, he aided the Jedi in finding the other Anzati masters. These masters were working with Bok, a Morgukai, to train the growing secret faction. Upon learning of them, Tholme sabotaged their efforts, causing them great displeasure before he killed them in the catacombs of Saleucami. Around 0 BBY, Dannik Jerriko, a male Anzat bounty hunter known as the Eater of Luck, came to prominence. He was paid handsomely for killing failed assassins, along with murderers, thieves and thugs for his own feeding, calculating that they would not be missed. He was irritable, being unable to tolerate clients who did not appreciate the value of his thorough work; as such, it was not uncommon for him to feed on an unhappy client. While searching for the \"soup\" of thieves on Tatooine, he encountered Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose life force he craved. However, he was unable to gain this and instead targeted the much more valuable Han Solo, in lieu of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's bounty on him. He was again unable to feed on his prey, and was later assigned to protect Tash Arranda, Zak Arranda, and Mammon Hoole. After that assignment, Jerriko returned to Tatooine to spy on Jabba. Still desirous of Solo's soup, the Anzati became excited upon the arrival of a carbonite slab containing Solo. However, Jerriko was deprived of his chance to drink Solo's soup when his Alliance to Restore the Republic comrades saved him. Frustrated at the loss of this opportunity, Jerriko accepted the option of feeding on Jabba, only to be foiled by the Hutt's death at the Great Pit of Carkoon. Mad with vampiric hunger and rage, Jerriko killed a number of unfortunate survivors at Jabba's Palace and then fled Tatooine to continue his endless search for beings on which to feed, with a large bounty on his own head by this time due to his actions. Feral Anzati: There appeared to be a feral species of Anzat who were capable of shooting a ropy webbing out of their torso to trap their prey, though this was only seen among the Anzati drawn to Volfe Karkko. They were believed to have been Anzati who went to Kiffex in reverence to Karkko during his imprisonment. Somehow he leeched their vitality, causing them to become degenerate and feral. They retained the ability to speak, but this was usually limited to single words and small phrases.",

      "description": "Arpor-Lan Arpor-Lan was the name of a sentient species of Humanoids with horned chins. Coming from Arporatal-Lanin, Arpor-Lans were famous through the galaxy as scouts and trackers. During the last centuries of the Galactic Republic, the Arpor-Lan were slaves to the noble houses ruling the Juvex sector. Later, some Arpor-Lan became officers of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, such as Lieutenants Deeve and Fraj T'lin. Biology & Appearance: Arpor-Lan were sentient Humanoids sharing a general physical outline with Humans: They had two arms and two legs, and continued effort made them hurt. They were known to sweat near their eyes, and they had a versatile enough tongue to manipulate the monitor pads of a breather mask. They were similar enough to Humans to use Human-oriented technology such as a face breather. An Arpor-Lan had hair on the top of the head, like a Human. However, the face showed two important disimilarities. The eyebrows of an Arpor-Lan showed external bones as plaques, and the chin showed stubby horns. Some Arpor-Lan tugged their horns or cleared their throats when nervous. Arpor-Lan were not immune to phobias. Society & Culture: Arpor-Lan's homeworld was Arporatal-Lanin, in the Juvex sector of the Mid Rim. The native Arpor-Lan were galaxy-wide famous as hunters, scouts and trackers. In times of the Galactic Civil War, Arpor-Lan travelled through the galaxy. A number of them were armed and instinctively drew a blaster when they felt threatened. History: Arpor-Lan were the native species of Arporatal-Lanin, a planet that had not been discovered by the galactic community. Circa 1,000 BBY, the tycoon Thul Vandron gathered seventeen noble houses of the Core Worlds and took them to a hidden cluster of worlds. These planets were divided in two groups, Senex and Juvex. Arportal-Lanin was in Juvex, an area that was assigned to Houses Carbinol, Hallikeenovich, Kassido, Kellermin, Mekuun, Pilor, Sisemon and Sreethyn. These aristocrats found native species in their worlds, and spent one century bending them using starships and blaster cannons. Arporatal-Lanin and the other planets in Juvex became property of the aristocrats. By 700 BBY, all the native species of Juvex, including the Arpor-Lan, had been enslaved for so long that they deemed freedom an old myth. But by then the Galactic Republic found Senex and Juvex and began a restless relationship with the ruling houses. Republic pilots heard rumors on the slave locals. In 553 BBY, a Republic warlord began to free some of the species in the area. During the Fourth Nantama Synod, the Houses joined the Republic, with Senex and Juvex becoming sectors. However, the Galactic Senate was unhappy with the slaving ways of the Houses, as they were violating the Rights of Sentience. The Houses demanded that they could keep that integral part of their culture. This led to a number of disputes during the following centuries. Arpor-Lan in the Galaxy: In 0 ABY, a number of Arpor-Lan had joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Lieutenant Fraj T'lin, an Arpor-Lan, served in the Rebel base on Yavin 4 soon after the Battle of Yavin. In 2 ABY, the premier scout Lieutenant Deeve was one of the more famous Arpor-Lan in the Alliance, and he also worked for Alliance Intelligence. During the New Republic, Deeve worked for the Bureau of Scouting and Exploration Services of the New Republic.",

General Sinick Kritkeen directed these experiments in an attempt to turn the pacifist species into feral warriors who would be useful to the New Order. Though the bounty hunter Dengar was contracted by the Aruzans to assassinate Kritkeen, it is likely that COMPNOR's \"Redesign\" efforts continued under a new COMPNOR officer, probably with severe reprisals carried out against the Aruzan population. A famous Aruzan was Manaroo, a dancer Dengar rescued from Aruza before she was scheduled for \"processing\".

      "description": "Askajian Askajians were a humanoid species from the planet Askaj. Externally, they appeared very similar to Humans, mainly differing in the thick, wrinkled skin on their forehead, their six breasts, and their girth. Internally, the Askajians were adapted to desert survival with large epidermal sacs for water storage. This allowed them to go for several weeks without water. An Askajian could shed up to sixty percent of the water in his or her body with no effect other than tremendous slimming. Askajians also had two hearts. Askajians lived in a primitive, tribal society, living mostly by gathering plants and hunting herds of large, woolly beasts called tomuons. One of the most important figures in an Askajian tribe was the weaver, who knew the secret techniques to create tomoun cloth. Tomoun cloth was a strong, yet soft and wrinkle-resistant fabric which was a high-demand luxury item as far away as the Core Worlds. As this was the only export the Askajians had, their tribes had been known to fight wars over the services of especially skilled weavers. The main political organizations among the Askajians were nomadic tribes composed of several extended families. These tribes were led by male or female herediary chieftains, depending on the region. Many tribes were formed loose military alliances with one another in order to make war on other tribal federations. Dancers were also important in Askajian culture. A skilled dancer acted as a shaman and loremaster, re-enacting tribal history and legend and leading worship of their main goddess, the Moon Lady. One of the most famous Askajians in galactic history was Yarna d'al' Gargan, who was one of Jabba's favorite dancers in his Palace. When she had stored as much water as she could hold, Yarna was said to remind Jabba of his mother. History: During the early years of the New Republic, several Askajian tribes migrated to Tatooine with the assistance of an Imperial defector, Gwend. They brought with them tomoun cloth to trade for the technology needed to survive on the planet. In 8 ABY a tribe of Askajians led by Borno helped Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and three Squib companions evade capture by Imperial Stormtroopers.",

      "description": "Assembler Assemblers were huge enigmatic arachnoids who lived in a large tube-like web floating in space. Their vacuum-resistant exoskeleton essentially allowed them to survive in such an environment. Each Assembler created Nodes—smaller arachnoid drones that lived to do the Assembler's bidding who were created from the primary intelligence's own neural tissue. Boba Fett discovered that Assemblers evolved from Nodes who killed their old master to take their place, sometimes through consumption of their creator. The only two Assemblers named in galactic history were Kud'ar Mub'at and Balancesheet, the masterminds who acted as a go-between for criminal organizations and potential employees. Assemblers absorbed all particles that floated by them that were not valuable, such as dust and space debris. No further information on the Assembler's biology, such as how they digest food, was known. They had four legs and two strange claws that acted as either hands or extra feet. In addition, Assemblers had strange furry appendages which grew on their backs, probably for absorbing food. Counting these, Assemblers had twelve appendages. These factors produced several psychological factors within the Assemblers as a species. One would be that they tended to be possessive creatures and would on occasion act as scavengers should anything be trapped in their web. These items would be used to enhance the Assemblers webs performance in someway. Another aspect of their behavior would be that an Assembler would often be jealous of its nodes and would actively try to limit their intelligence and prevent them from becoming sentient. Assemblers were connected to their webs by neurofibers, and the webs were connected to the Nodes in the same way. Kud'ar Mub'at had many Nodes to carry out day-to-day things. \"Lookout\" gazed through his single-lens eye to view the web's exterior, looking for problems and such. Calculator was much like a computer, interpreting data, and Identifier identified objects, ships, and people to see if they were valuable, dangerous, or not. Three nodes worked in Mu'bat's docking bay: Signaler guided ships in by waving his hands and with his glowing green eye, while Docker and Handler secured ships to the web with their tentacles. Listener heard sounds around the web with his tympanic membranes, and Balancesheet worked with Calculator to maintain Mu'bat's finances. It was Balancesheet that eventually rebelled against its creator, having reached the level of sentience where a node began to want to become the next Assembler. However, it was important for these nodes to remain useful to the primary Assembler as those that had no function would easily be re-ingested so that vital genetic information can be saved and reused for later use. Balancesheet appears, however, to have learned the lesson that his parent failed to learn fast enough, choosing to operate a freighter sold to him by Black Sun instead of relying on his own creations, which creates the risk of those creations revolting. An interesting facet of the species was that should an Assembler be killed but still possessed its body then it was possible to resurrect it. This required the application of a power to the web of the Assembler and the restoration of certain parts of the web to allow for memory to be 'remembered'. Boba Fett was able to do this with a pulsator and the Hound's Tooth around 4 ABY.",

Ayrou were descended from birdlike species, though they themselves were flightless humanoids. By reputation, they were a peaceful species, and experts in gathering information. Biology & Appearance: The harmonics in their voices made many species uncomfortable. Some Humans described Ayrou vocalizations as \"blood-curdling\", and other listeners likened the Ayrou language to a songbird being strangled. Some species even claimed actual physical harm (such as lost egg clutches) from hearing Ayrou speak. Their version of a snort was a warbling scream. Though their voices were often considered unpleasant, their appearance was generally held to be attractive. They were a tall, slim species, typically around two meters tall but only 65 kilograms in mass. They had long, triple-jointed limbs, with four tapered fingers on each hand. Their skin ranged from milky white to light purple. Ayrou had wide-spaced eyes, which came in brilliant shades of red, blue, or green. Their avian ancestry was obvious from the dazzling plumage they had instead of hair. Ayrou spent much of their time preening their feathers, since their appearance reflected their health and social status. Society & Culture: Ayrou had an instinct to hoard items for future use: a trait non-Ayrou sometimes mistook for simple greed, but which the Ayrou themselves regarded as merely practical. This trait carried over to a drive to collect as much information as possible about anything and everything. It also made them treat haggling and negotiations as an art form. It did not carry over to aggressiveness or covetousness, however. Ayrou considered violence the mark of those who could not succeed through their intellects. Ayrou leaders would often debate a cultural or religious issue for several generations, before abruptly coming to a single conclusion. These sudden switches often baffled non-Ayrou observers. As one of the first species to develop spaceflight in the Moddell sector, Ayrou were politically influential in their home sector. They had established populations on the factory world Ovise III, the penal colony of Thonner, the Vashan homeworld of Vasha, and the sector capital world Annaj. In 19 ABY, Ayrou Senator Muchardis Mulaxis represented the Moddell Sector in the New Republic Senate. This senator was skeptical of Borsk Fey'lya's claims during the Caamas Document Crisis that the Bothans did not know which clans bore responsibility for the destruction of Caamas.

They were covered with thick fur, though they also had a dual lung/gill system which enabled them to breathe both air and water. They also had webbing between each digit and flexible, long tails. Balinaka also had excellent vision, and could see in dark conditions. Their diet consisted mostly of fish. The Balinaka shared Garnib with the Vernols. Their homeworld was extremely cold, with several continents covered by glaciers dozens of meters thick. The Balinaka carved entire underground cities called Sewfes. The Balinaka were also skilled at sculpting ice, a skill which won them fame throughout the galaxy. Balinaka were encountered often enough by Rebel SpecOps personnel to acquire the nickname \"bears.\" In the Senex sector, Balinaka and Ossan were used as slaves by House Vandron on Karfeddion and other worlds.",

      "description": "Balosar Balosars were humanoids with retractable antennapalps. They were indigenous to Balosar. Biology & Appearance: The Balosar's antennapalps allowed them to listen into the subsonic range. Their antennapalps also gave the species a physical intuition, which the Jedi sometimes mistook for Force sensitivity. Their antennapalps could also sense surges in emotion and could detect danger. They used these abilities to help them survive on their crime-infested world. Balosars were also resistant to toxin, despite their frail physiques. This immunity can be attributed to their planet's polluted atmosphere, giving them a high resistance. A Balosar reached adulthood at age 16. Average life expectancy for a Balosar was roughly 65 years. Society: Balosars were commonly stereotyped as spineless, weak-willed, depressed, sarcastic, cynical, and selfish. However, they acquired these traits due to their planet's pollution. The Journal of Personality and Galactic Psychology did not indicate any sort of genetic link to these emotions. Balosars often left their homeworld to look for a more prosperous place to live. Since many carried criminal records, they were perceived as self-absorbed individuals who had a difficult time determining right from wrong. Young Balosars were commonly sent to worlds with better education. Death sticks were a devastating factor in Balosar society, where they addict users, forcing them to purchase more. Pollution is one of the causes of the heavy addiction to death sticks, but the Balosar's immunity to toxin allows them to consume them without much effect other than the life-long addiction. Some Balosars even entered the death stick business, where they would travel in hopes of finding potential customers. History: During the reign of the Galactic Republic, illegal trade in death sticks became the greatest competition to the spice from Ryloth called ryll. The rivalry resulted in a hatred between the Balosars and Twi'leks. By the time the New Republic was formed, Balosar's pollution seeped into the balo mushroom farms destroying the Balosar's economy. The Balosars had no choice but to join the Twi'lek's spice industry as low-level runners. When the Yuuzhan Vong War occurred, the Balosars were not bound to treaties with the New Republic and were therefore not protected by its military. However, they escaped the Yuuzhan Vong's conquest and their planet remained as it always was throughout the invasion. Common Balosar Names: *Nina Dar'Eboros *Vaya Bar'jaraka *Zirk Mer'darro",

      "description": "Baragwin The Baragwin people were a species of very large reptilian bipeds. Biology & Appearance: Baragwin were easily recognized by their hunched backs, wrinkled skin, and large heads mounted on thick necks. There were no obvious differences between male and female Baragwin. Physically, Baragwin were noted for their thick skin which could resist most physical attacks, and their shuffling gait. This made them powerful, but slow, warriors. Baragwin also had an acute sense of smell, sensitive enough to detect a person's mood. This led some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-Baragwin believed the Baragwin to be a dull-witted people. Baragwin were, in fact, quite intelligent, but they frequently kept this hidden, using the misconceptions of others to their own advantage. History: Though their population numbered only in the millions, they were widespread throughout the galaxy, having been part of galactic society for millennia. Their original homeworld was lost to legend. Instead, like Humans, individuals identified themselves with the planet they were raised on. Baragwin culture, since it did not derive from a single homeworld, was highly dependent on a Baragwin's planet of origin (with Tatooinian Baragwin behaving quite differently from those from Denuhi-Eight.) Baragwin generally had little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins (though criminal Baragwins would exploit all beings equally instead). Baragwin settlements were generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin were famous as skilled weapon-smiths. During the Jedi Civil War, Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades were among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy. This tradition continued into the Galactic Civil War era, where Baragwin were found working for Imperial-backed corporations, criminals, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Among the Baragwin armorers at that time was Hermi Odle, a security expert working for Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Since the Empire and Imperial-backed corporations prized the contribution of Baragwin weapons engineering, most Baragwin supported the Empire during the Galactic Civil War. When Ysanne Isard released the Krytos virus in order to decimate the nonhuman population of Coruscant; however, the planet's Baragwin community was hit hard. The majority of Baragwin reacted by throwing their support behind the fledgling New Republic. In 25 ABY, the numerous Baragwin communities were represented in the New Republic Senate by Senator Wynl. Baragwin Naming Customs: Most Baragwin had a first and a second name. Typical names included Dagel Igara, Digo Fadani, and Idalli Kodrue. Senator Wynl, who apparently had only one name, was one of the few known exceptions.",

Their bodies also had the ability to have parts that have been cut off in combat to continue functioning as normal. If decapitated, for example, the body would continue to fight as if it were still attached to the head. They also had a grasp on telepathy, where if one were to be in danger, they could simply call on their \"hive\" to save them. Tenel Ka, Jaina Solo, and Jacen Solo found them to be worthy adversaries.

      "description": "Berrite The Berrites of the planet Berri were considered to be stupid and clumsy by most other species, though they could be deceptively cunning. Berrites were one-meter tall creatures with two arms and four legs. Their skin was green and wrinkled, with patches of coarse black hair. They had poor vision and hearing, but they had a natural sonar ability which compensated for these deficiencies. All Berrites were hermaphrodites, though they would take on male or female identities when dealing with aliens depending on which sex would get them better treatment. They often had trouble telling male and female aliens apart. When Berrites reproduced, one would take on a male role and fertilize another's eggs. The second would take on a female role, carrying the eggs (usually three) within \"her\" skin folds. Hatchlings grew to full size within one year, but did not reproduce until the age of sixty. Berrites could live to be four hundred years old. Berrites were master foragers, sharing the scarce resources of their homeworld with one another in a spirit of anarchic cooperation. They often gathered together for hours on end to chew the food stored in their cheek pouches and listen to stories. Though Berrites had been known to galactic society for a long time, their planet attracted little trade, so few Berrites left Berri. Despite the scarcity of natural resources, the Galactic Empire made several attempts to enslave the Berrites and make Berri a factory planet. However, Berrites responded to Imperial pressure by pretending to be much stupider than they really were. After high accident rates and defective products, the planetary Governor gave up and requested a transfer. This behavior was typical of the Berrite response to pressure, which preferred cheerful uncooperativeness and feigned stupidity to violent conflict. Famous Berrites included Mexnean, a con-\"woman\" and petty thief active during the Galactic Civil War.",

      "description": "Besalisk Besalisks, also known as Ojom, were a race of multi-armed humanoids from the cold ocean world of Ojom. Besalisks evolved from large, flightless avians, though were often mistaken for a reptilian species. Biology & Appearance: A stocky species which evolved from avians, the Besalisk are flightless and are often mistaken for reptilians due to their scales, sharp teeth, and long claws. Male Besalisks' heads sported prominent crests and four arms hung at their sides; females of the species could have as many as eight arms, but like Humans had a primary hand and a limited range of functionality with the others. The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed. A monogamous species, Besalisks choose a mate for life and often bare one or two eggs. Mating rituals are violent and highly competitive, taking place during the warmer months at specified conclaves. Besalisks are hatched from eggs, carried by the females which lay their young during warm seasons. Before the eggs hatched, a male Besalisk would store the egg close to their body under a large brood patch in his abdominal skin. Because of the chill of Ojom, Besaliks were equipped to survive in harsh conditions, causing them to sweat profusely when on planets with a warmer climate. Chatty, quick to form lasting friendships and lovers of adventure, Besalisks often were fearless and sought thrills without care for themselves. This often caused trouble amongst their employers; Besalisks were known to walk off the job when bored with it and never return. When Besalisks did take jobs in the underworld, they were prone to gossiping and being lose-lipped, making them one of the galaxies species with the most members with bounties on their heads. Society & Culture: Because of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claimed territories around the world and were each led by an elected leader. The communes had a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grew in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier. While not involved in galactic politics and because they did not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlds could come to do business. Trading and making deals, any violence on these stations was committed by offworlders as Besalisks avoid confrontation. History: Isolated in the hard-to-navigate Deep Core, Besalisks never sought representation in the Senate of the Galactic Republic, and were content to let galactic affairs continue without their involvement. Ojom avoided Imperial occupation and enslavement by calling in favors with various influential underworld connections—though many Besalisks spent years working off this debt, especially those foolish or desperate enough to seek aid from the Hutts. After his defeat during the Post-Zsinj campaign, High Admiral Treuten Teradoc fled in the Deep Core where he created his small empire. Ojom was one of the planets controled by the warlord. Like other Deep Core systems, the Ojom system was probably abandoned after the Imperial Reunification in 12 ABY. Besalisk in the Galaxy: Quick-witted and sociable, Besalisks easily integrated into any civilized society, though few Besalisk colonies existed outside of sparsely-populated Ojom. Despite a lack of colonies, Besalisks often traveled off Ojom and found occupations which suited their thirst for adventure, though often proving to be unreliable in the sense they tended to wander and never return to the job. A notable member of the Besalisk species was Dexter Jettster, a gruff, honest being who owned a diner in Coruscant's CoCo Town district. Formerly a prospector beyond on Kessel, Jettster was a reliable asset to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. While not prevalent, the Force manifested itself in some members of the species; Pong Krell went on to obtain the rank of Master within the Jedi Order during the final days of the Republic. Fighting in the Clone Wars, Master Krell became disenchanted with the Order and the Republic and sought to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems after envisioning their victory at the end of the conflict. Before he could follow through with his plan to defect, the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic under his command executed him for treason.",

      "name": "Bilar",
      "plural": "Bilars",
      "description": "Bilar Bilars were one of the few examples of a true group mind in the galaxy. Evolved from small, vegetarian primates on the tectonically active but highly fertile planet Mima II, each member of the species was a hairless, pink creature with large, dark eyes, a short muzzle, and two rounded ears. An individual Bilar was unintelligent, but the species had the ability to pool the knowledge and consciousnesses of groups of Bilars who shared a special bond with one another, creating conglomerations known as a claqas. Thus, a pair of Bilars collectively was as intelligent as a trained domestic animal, but a group of four achieved true sentience. The group mind developed shortly after the birth of those Bilars born nearby and within a few minutes of each other. The group mind depended on single Bilars sharing thoughts through pheromones, physical and visual contact, and telepathy. Larger claqas grew progressively smarter, with seven-member groups achieving genius-level intellects. Claqas with more than ten members were rare, and claqas generally referred to themselves as a single individual and went by a single name. Separation of any of the constituent Bilars resulted in a temporary loss of intelligence, and the death of a Bilar sent his or her claqa into a deep depression, sometimes leading to catatonia or the death of the whole. The plant life of Mima II was so lush that it provided the Bilars with a comfortable and carefree existence. Claqas of five or more members preferred to live in urban environments situated in stable fields on the planet, and the species had access to mass production and other advanced technology. However, the goods they had to offer were of little interest to outsiders. Coupled with the fact that many non-Bilars found interacting with a group mind unnerving, Bilars had limited contact with the rest of the galaxy. When they did manage to venture offworld, their generally carefree existences on Mima II left them unused to deprivation. Nevertheless, a few Bilar claqas did venture into the greater galaxy to work at occupations that made use of their ability to work together seamlessly. Biology & Appearance: Reactions to the Bilars' appearance ranged from one extreme to another: to some non-Bilars, the species was the epitome of adorability, resembling children's stuffed toys. To others, however, they were the pinnacle of revulsion. Bilars were hairless, pink-skinned primates with a bilateral physiology of two forelimbs, two hindlimbs, a head, and a torso. On solid footing, their primary means of locomotion was to stand on their stubby back legs and walk bipedally, but they sometimes leaned the torso forward slightly, bringing their longer forelimbs to the ground to scamper on all four appendages, each of which ended in five stubby digits. The species' fastest means of movement, however, was to brachiate, swinging through the trees and vines of their jungle habitat. Upright, the average Bilar stood one meter tall. Unlike many other species of mammals, Bilars were completely hairless, leaving their wrinkly pink skin exposed to the elements and revealing the nipples and navel. However, due to the natural protection afforded by their homeworld's lush foliage, this adaptation sped up heat transfer and helped control body temperature. The Bilar head was roughly spherical and featured two large, dark, amygdaloid eyes under dainty brows. These visual organs slanted slightly upward toward the temples, gave the Bilars excellent low-light vision, and allowed them to see partially into the infrared spectrum. Two round ears stood erect at the top of the head; by rotating these organs, a Bilar could hone in on faint sounds, detecting even sounds falling within the infra- and ultrasonic ranges. The short Bilar snout ended in a moist, black nose, which facilitated respiration, and a wide maw with its corners turned up in a perpetual smile. Bilars were herbivorous. A single Bilar was non-sentient, roughly as intelligent as a common rodent. However, each member of the species had a unique ability to bond with certain other Bilars, pooling their intellects into a communal intelligence known as a claqa. The biological mechanisms involved in this process were ill-understood by scientists, but they seemed to include a mixture of pheromones, physical touch, and telepathy. Thus, a claqa of two Bilars had the same intellectual ability as a domesticated canine or equine, a claqa of three that of a lower primate, and a claqa of four true sentience. Greater numbers in the claqa boosted the group's intelligence even higher: seven-member claqas were geniuses by most species' standards, and ten-member claqas were recorded. Society & Culture: The Bilars inhabited the jungles of Mima II, a planet teeming with plant and animal life. Although each claqa operated as a single consciousness with a single identity, the plural nature of the Bilar group mind ensured that each claqa manifested a unique temperament. In fact, the same claqa might change its mood erratically or capriciously, confusing any non-Bilars interacting with it. Nevertheless, a few behaviors appeared among even individual Bilars. The species tended to be libertine creatures, concerned only with enjoying themselves. Bilars were non-violent and bashful by nature, prone to flee at the first sign of danger. For smaller claqas, the Bilars might climb a tree, fall to the ground, or plunge into a river to avoid a predator such as the riam, a flying snake able to eat a Bilar in a single gulp. Larger and more intelligent claqas, alternatively, defended themselves by laying traps for such carnivores, perhaps laying out a large net with a single Bilar in it as bait. Their innate curiosity made Bilars fearless creatures in other contexts, eager to seek out new experiences. Of course, the nature of the claqa group mind made Bilars into intensely social creatures; Bilars almost always traveled in groups, and their philosophy told of a common overmind, a concept that made the thought of war untenable in Bilar sentiment, at least between claqas. Bilar reproductive processes were synchronized so that several pregnant females gave birth within a short time. Expectant mothers were kept within close proximity to one another to ensure that their offspring were born in close quarters with other newborns. After they were born, Bilars immediately began forming an intense bond with other infants born within a few days of them in the same locality. Eventually, the Bilar infants achieved a state of communal consciousness, bringing about a new claqa. These groups functioned at full intelligence as long as each member of the group was within eyeshot of at least one other; should the constituent Bilars lose sight of one another, the claqa's overall intelligence fell until the group could be reunited. The bond was so strong that outsiders could rarely tell the constituent members of a claqa apart from one another; doing so was largely an academic exercise anyway, as each Bilar had no identity outside his or her group mind. If one member of a claqa died, the other Bilars entered a state of intense melancholy and even catatonia. In extreme cases, the surviving Bilars would even die. Sheltered by the trees of Mima II, Bilars lived a life of abundance, gathering food from the forests' lower levels, or swinging about on vines and branches. The plenitude of food on the world meant that Bilars had little concept of deprivation—all of their needs were met with very little effort on their part. Outsiders who visited Mima II often complained that Bilars on the world were unmotivated and boring. Only when away from their home environment did Bilar claqas develop more remarkable goals and drives. Offworld Bilars also had to contend with a greater struggle to meet their daily needs; if denied something they wanted, the beings often whined and complained like the young of many species. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Bilars had access to advanced technology but had not discovered the secrets of nuclear power. Their native technology was oriented toward mass production of goods. Claqas of five or more members tended to congregate in Bilar cities, located in a central region of Mima II that was spared the worst of the planet's erratic plate tectonics. The copious food available in the forests obviated any need for agriculture, and even in the urban environment, Bilars had ready access to food by simply visiting a city park and climbing a tree to eat its fruit. However, this abundance also meant that the Bilars desired little from the outside galaxy—and the outside galaxy desired little from them. Still, the lack of traders visiting Mima II had just as much to do with the intimidation factor of negotiating with a group intelligence as it did with the world's relatively unpromising trade prospects. History: The Bilars evolved on Mima II from unintelligent primates. The presence of predators on the world encouraged the species to evolve into intensely social creatures, drawing safety from living in groups. Eventually, this gregariousness became so ingrained in the species that those Bilars who were born within a few days of one another formed an even more profound bond than that among the species as a whole. Within a few generations, this bonding from birth had become an indelible part of the Bilar genetic code; the species' reproductive cycles encouraged the birth of young in waves to maximize the chances of each newborn bonding with as many fellow Bilars as possible. At some point, this group formation moved to another level entirely, with children born within minutes of one another forming not just intense social bonds, but communal intelligence and consciousness as well; the claqa had evolved. With the development of group-based sentience, the Bilars learned to manipulate tools and to defend themselves from predators. They moved to the top of their world's food chain, becoming the dominant species of Mima II's jungles. The species' technology continued to progress, reaching mass production by the time of the Galactic Civil War and emphasizing the creation of urban centers. At some point between 3,000 and 1,000 BBY, the Bilars made first contact with the outside galaxy, and Mima II became part of the D'Aelgoth sector, in the Western Reaches of the Mid Rim. While the Clone Wars raged, Mima II fell within territory controlled by the Galactic Republic. During the regime of Emperor Palpatine, Imperial sentientologist Obo Rin included an entry on the Bilars in his Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy, a work in which he described those sentient species he considered to be the most important in the galaxy and of the most interest to the Empire. In 137 ABY, Mima II fell within territory controlled by Darth Krayt as part of his Galactic Empire. Bilar in the Galaxy: Few Bilar claqas ventured into the greater galaxy from Mima II. This was partially due to lack of opportunity to leave: the species lacked indigenous spacefaring technology, and traffic to their world was minimal. However, it was also a result of the relative poverty of the Bilars by galactic standards; although the average claqa had all its needs met with little expenditure of energy, Bilars had little of value with which to barter travel off Mima II. Nevertheless, a few Bilar claqas managed to find transport off their homeworld and enter the galactic community. These claqas were often highly intelligent, frequently finding work in jobs that took advantage of their group mind. Some Bilars worked as acrobat troupes, theater companies, and musical groups, while others ventured into the galactic underworld, working as assassins, hucksters, crime lords, and slicers. One ten-unit claqa, which collectively went by the name Unni Yerudi, became an interplanetary con artist. Yerudi owned several clubs on Bespin's Cloud City and eventually became the richest being in the Anoat sector. Still, few Bilar claqas remained abroad for long. Bilars faced intense discrimination from members of other species, whose fear and mistrust of the Bilar group mind ranged from prejudice to execration. For instance, in Elrood sector slang, Bilars were known as ticktils, from the acronym TCTL: \"Too Cute Too Live.\" In 16 ABY, a publication was for sale in Talos spaceport on the planet Atzerri that promised to teach its readers the secrets of forming group minds like those of the Bilar claqas, for instance, and one Bilar was killed in a fit of rage by the Kerestian bounty hunter Milacass after the Kerestian lost a hand of Sabacc with a gambler from the Oseon system. Most claqas came to miss the idyllic life they had left behind on Mima II. Chubar was a fictional Bilar in an animated children's holoprogram. The character was a solitary Bilar kept as a pet by a young girl; the Bilar's voice was supplied by the actor \"Face\" Loran. Imperial scientists later gave the character's name to Project Chubar, a program of chemical treatments and educational programs that aimed to raise the overall intelligence of Bilars, Ewoks, Gamorreans, and other non-Human species and to bring their mental processes more in-line with those of Humans. In 7 ABY, Bilars were among the beings undergoing intelligence enhancement as part of Project Minefield, a successor program to Project Chubar authorized by the Imperial warlord Zsinj aboard his Super Star Destroyer, the Iron Fist. The Bilars were later freed by Lara Notsil and helped her escape the ship.",

      "name": "Bimm",
      "plural": "Bimms",
      "description": "Bimm The Bimms were diminutive humanoids from the planet Bimmisaari. The Bimms consisted of two species—one, a Near-Human race, the other a floppy-eared, furred humanoid species. Though the two species were completely unrelated biologically, they shared a language and cultural identity as Bimms. Many descriptions of Bimm culture and society ignored the biological differences between the two species. The Bimms had a reputation as a peaceful, hospitable people. Many traveled the galaxy working as merchants and artists. Others remained on their homeworld, or lived in Bimm enclaves on a variety of planets. Some of the best-known Bimms in galactic history went against their people's stereotypical, inoffensive demeanor, however. These included the Sith adept and serial murderer Toki Tollivar, and an unidentified Bimm who impersonated the Prophet of the Dark Side Kadann and later laid claim to the Imperial throne. Biology & Appearance: One of the Bimm species was thought to have evolved on Bimmisaari. They were slightly taller than the Near-Human Bimms, with an adult height of 1.0 to 1.6 meters, with the females being slightly taller on average. They were covered in short fur that ranged from black to tan in color. Their faces had floppy ears, long muzzles, and small black eyes. Their hands possessed three long fingers and a thumb each. The Near-Human Bimms differed from the Human norm primarily in their short stature, which ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 meters for adults of both sexes. Near-Human Bimms were often said to resemble Human children, though males frequently, and proudly, grew full beards. Xenobiologists believed that the Near-Human Bimms arrived on Bimmisaari from a nearby planet eons before the rise of the Galactic Empire, and adopted the culture of the original Bimm species. No other animal species on Bimmisaari was genetically related to them. Both species called themselves simply \"Bimms\" and lived harmoniously with each other in their shared forest cities. They considered themselves to be a united people, and were considered as such by the rest of the galaxy. Intermarriage between the two Bimm species was not uncommon, though genetic incompatibilities required such couples to adopt if they wanted children. Society & Culture: Though the Bimm species had lived together for almost all of their recorded history, certain aspects of their culture were more associated with one species than with another. While some sources attributed these cultural tendencies to one species or the other, sources such as Mammon Hoole presented them as aspects of a single, shared culture. Bimms, especially the Near-Human Bimms, were fond of art, music, and storytelling. Their favorite stories involved heroic adventures, though they were usually content to hear the stories rather than inspired to take part in adventures themselves. The language Bimmini, which was used by both species, was sung, rather than spoken. A Bimm conversation had a seemingly mystical quality, sounding to Human ears like songs being sung in five-part harmony. The furred Bimms were particularly good merchants, and felt the day was incomplete without a good round of shopping and haggling. The art of bargaining was respected in their culture, and fair dealing was highly honored. However, cheating and theft were tantamount to murder in their society. Furred Bimms were also noted for their yellow clothing. Both species were noted for their mild-tempered, peaceful tendencies, which was the reason the two species lived together in harmony. This tendency extended to non-Bimm visitors from offworld, who would be treated as honored guests. The Bimm greeting ritual involved a reception line which each visitor would walk through. In complete silence, each Bimm in line would reach out and gently touch the visitor's head, arm, or back. More important visitors would attract correspondingly large crowds in the procession. This honor did not extend to armed visitors, however, who would be expected to leave their weapons behind. History: Bimms were in contact with the Galactic Republic as early as the Great Sith War. One furred Bimm, Toki Tollivar, defected to the Sith Empire and became a Sith adept. At the war's end, he began a private campaign of revenge and serial murder, before being defeated by the Mandalorian Crusader Rohlan Dyre. As the Galactic Republic's government became too corrupt in its later years, Bimmisaari quietly withdrew. Luckily for the Bimms, their homeworld was remote enough that few took notice of this, allowing their people to escape most of the chaos of the Republic's fall and the later oppression of the Galactic Empire. After the Battle of Endor, the Bimms remained neutral, but friendly toward the Alliance to Restore the Republic and later, the New Republic. One Bimm who defied the pacifist Bimm norm during the Galactic Civil War was the false Kadann, a Near-Human Bimm and Imperial Intelligence agent who impersonated the Prophet of the Dark Side Kadann, and later declared himself Galactic Emperor. After the fall of the false Kadann, Leia Organa Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo were part of a New Republic mission in 9 ABY which was meant to open negotiations for the Bimms to join the Republic. The Shi'ido anthropologist Mammon Hoole included an entry on the Bimms in his publication The Essential Guide to Alien Species. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Bimms became one of the species most direly effected by the invasion of extragalactic invaders. Bimm in the Galaxy: Near-Human Bimms were the most frequently encountered type of Bimms in the galaxy. While Near-Human Bimms who left their homeworld were typically entertainers or scholars, humanoid Bimms who went offworld were usually traders or businesspeople. Some Bimms became adventurers, whether as scoundrels who somehow worked their way into the circles of nobility, or as artists who followed heroes in order to witness great deeds which they could record in ballads. Entire communities of Bimms were also found in enclaves off Bimmisaari, which were noted for their hospitality. The Bimms also held great respect for the Jedi. Bimms of both species became Jedi during the days of the Galactic Republic. Even after the Republic's fall, tales of Jedi such as Murrtaggh were popular among Bimm bards. Even Bimmisaari's laws prohibiting visitors from carrying weapons were relaxed for visiting Jedi carrying lightsabers. During the time of the Clone Wars, a group of five Bimm investors visited the Cularin Trade Show, which was being held in the Cularin system, aboard the starship TAV Prosperity. During the show, the ship suffered a hyperdrive failure in the region of the Cularin comet cloud, causing a booth to fall on the investors. Bimm artists such as Ha'lathin or Vasnish Kay, and traders and smugglers such as Rycar Ryjerd and Rayc Ryjerd, were typical of Bimms in the galaxy.",

Fully adapted to a civilized, high-technology lifestyle, Bith were found galaxy-wide at all levels of society, most notably as engineers, scientists, intellectuals, consultants, and musicians. Some Bith also possessed pronounced Force powers and existed as both Jedi and Sith in the galaxy. Biology & Appearance: Bith were craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or (rarely) green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems were different from most humanoids, as the Bith had only one lung, and exhaled through their skin. Bith also lacked a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the flaps of their cheeks. The other Bith senses were also acute. Bith could sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other races sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, were able to focus to 0.07 on the Gandok Scale and they could see microscopic details of nearby objects, but were extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors was the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It was described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith had high manual dexterity which helped them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average. Bith had even evolved past the need for sleep. Instead, they would slip into a light meditative trance, which allowed them to get as much rest in four hours as other species could get in eight. During this trance, Bith were still almost fully aware of their surroundings. A Bith's reproductive organs atrophied over time, as did the portions of their brain governing such impulses. As such, Bith were unable to reproduce naturally, instead relying on artificial conception and gestation. Mates brought genetic material to a Computer Mating Service for analysis against prospective mates. Bith children were created from genetic material from two parents, which was combined, fertilized, and incubated for a year. History: Bith were one of the galaxy's most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garnered respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, \"younger\" species. Their society was highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs. Circa 320 BBY, the Bith city-states of Nozho and Weogar engaged in a massive civil war using biological weapons over patent rights to a new hyperdrive. The aftermath of the Nozho–Weogar War destroyed Clak'dor VII's ecosystem and crippled the Bith industrial capacity, forcing the Bith to retreat to sealed cities and rely on imported goods and machinery to keep their society functioning. The Y'bith, a subspecies of Bith, were descended from Bith whose genetic code was altered in the aftermath of a biological attack on Nozho. These \"ghost Bith\" resettled on Clak'dor IV and developed their own society, somewhat estranged from the Bith mainstream. In 67 BBY, while Darth Plagueis and his master Darth Tenebrous were stationed on the planet Bal'demnic, Plagueis killed the latter, stating that he planned to overthrow the Rule of Two, establishing a new order of his own, that would stay for a thousand years under his control. The war also brought out a strong pacifistic streak in Bith culture. For example, they attempted to remain neutral during the Separatist Crisis, though they were eventually coerced into supporting the Confederacy of Independent Systems against the Galactic Republic. While they viewed the Republic as morally corrupt, they restricted their support of the CIS to technological and artistic contributions. Not all Bith joined with the Separatists, however—notably Jedi Master Ph'ton, who served the Republic as a Senior General during the Clone Wars. Many other Bith had served the Republic as Jedi Consulars over the years: some of them were rumored to have survived the Great Jedi Purge by hiding on their homeworld. Both the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire made the Bith uneasy about conditions in the rest of the galaxy, with most Bith choosing to wait out the Dark Times within Clak'dor VII's sealed cities. After the Clone Wars ended, the Bith did not resist the Empire, instead putting their technical expertise at the service of the Imperial war machine. The Bith were horrified by the Empire, however, and were among the first species to be liberated by the New Republic in 5 ABY. The Bith did not emerge fully from their isolation until 8 ABY, shortly after the Hapans rejoined the Galactic community. Bith in the Galaxy: Ever since the Nozho-Weogar War, Clak'dor VII's main exports were the products of the Bith intellect. Many Bith worked as engineers, data analysts, or in other intellectual professions. Others used their intelligence, natural technical skills, and dexterity to work in the criminal underworld. Many Bith worked as cantina staff, since bartenders in Bith society held a position equivalent in many ways to priests in other cultures. The Intelligence Quartermaster for Imperial Intelligence during the Cold War was a Bith stationed on the Imperial Fleet. Their hearing also made Bith such as Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes(the house band in the Mos Eisley Cantina circa 0 BBY) excellent musicians.",

      "plural": "Bitthaevrians",
      "description": "Bitthaevrian The Bitthævrians were warlike, bipedal sapients native to Guiteica, in the Kadok Regions. Biology & Appearance: The Bitthævrians were tall creatures with heavily muscled bodies. They had a leather-like skin protecting them from physical damage. The color of that hide was typically sandy pink or a rusty brown, but variations were wide, including tan-colored Bitthævrians living in equatorial areas and dark brown- or black-colored Bitthævrians living in the north. Bitthævrians also had a row sharp fangs,which jutted from their mouths. These fangs were used in personal combat. The knees and elbows of Bitthævrians were covered with sharp quills used in personal combat as piercing weapons. The quills were not particularly hard, and they were often broken or lost, but they were constantly replaced. As the Bitthævrian aged, those quills became more resilient and larger. Bitthævrians vision ranged into the infrared, allowing them to see heat sources (such as living beings or recently fired sidearms) in complete darkness. Society & Culture: Bitthævrian culture was based on personal combat and fighting readiness. The status of a Bitthævrian was based on his or her personal skill as a fighter, with the greatest warrior becoming the leader of their people. The leader was absolutely respected. People dishonoring a leader would be chased by Bitthævrians even if they left Guiteica. Being highly isolationist, Bitthævrians tended to leave only to pursue the most serious offenders. The personal weapon of a Bitthævrian was commonly the dematoil, a customized morningstar with Bitthævrian joint quills attached to the ball. Every time a Bitthævrian was defeated by another in personal combat, the winner was allowed to take the loser's biggest quill from his arm and attach it to his dematoil. Naming Conventions: Bitthævrian naming convention was atypical, with a Bitthævrian having three or four names. The first name of a Bitthævrian was the season when he or she was born. There are seven seasons in Guiteica: Giil, Quul, Aul, Zuol, Tweil, Jael and Quaal. The second name is the family name, which was inherited from the mother's maternal surname. A male Bitthævrian adopted a third name when married: His wife's surname. The fourth name (third in females and single males) was the Bitthævrian's personal name, used normally only as a form of familiar address, by friends, family, and cohorts. History: At least five decades before the Battle of Yavin, the Bitthævrians started a war in protest of Republic interference in the Kadok Regions. Right from the start the Republic played-up the threat posed by the Bitthævrians in order to gain allies to bolster its increasingly small armed forces. At length the Republic defeated them with an army of Jedi and Kaleesh. The m'Yalfor'ac Order, one of the biggest Bitthævrian armies, killed several Jedi Knights, but they were eventually defeated. The Bitthævrians afterward hated the Republic as a whole, despising its values and methods. Although they were also unhappy with the Galactic Empire, they considered it to be the lesser of two evils. Bitthævrians also felt hatred towards any Force-user, due to the Jedi implication in their defeat, and towards Bothans because of the Bothan tendency to mislead, lie and avoid direct conflict, behavior which was anathema to the Bitthævrian beliefs. The Bitthævrian planetary defense force, the Guiteica Militia, was rebuilt around 2 ABY, led by Colonel Quaal Tavier Catharius of the m'Yalfor'ac Order as a continental army in l'Quart'a with support from the other fifteen continents of Guiteica. The m'Yalfor'ac Order considered the Rebel Alliance, as official heir of the Old Republic, to be an inherited enemy. However, their isolationist tendencies and use of obsolete equipment made them little threat to the Rebel Alliance; they mostly just became a headache for Moff Rhain Towith of Kadok Regions. Vulca Minerals tried to perform yttrium mining activities in Guiteica, but the pushy attitude of Vulca officers led to a more aggressive attitude from the m'Yalfor'ac Order. The crisis was witnessed by Vulca officer and later Rebel lieutenant Ayla Shar. After that crisis, Kadok Resources, a Bitthævrian-controlled operation, managed all of Guiteica's exports.",

      "description": "Blood Carver Blood Carvers were an almost insect-like alien race native to Batorine. Biology & Appearance: Blood Carvers were humanoids with gold skin, dark eyes and beaklike noses. They believed in the Art Beyond Dying, and had orange blood. Their noses served as both olfactory and auditory systems. Among Blood Carvers, extension was an extreme form of probation, a temporary exile from one's clan. Tribal tattoos were common for Blood Carvers. Society & Culture: Their name officially came from the statues they carved from blood red trees. When a Blood Carver presented a statue, it immediately wanted flaws pointed out, while compliments were actually tantamount to insults. Creatures had been executed for complimenting works of art. The statues were made for the betterment of the tribe, not the individual. The second reason for their name came from the fact that they were very skilled assassins, though it was quite rare for a Blood Carver to mutilate their target. A traditional Blood Carver prayer, offered before battle, ran, \"May my blade be sharp. May I sculpt a new fate for my enemies.\" History: Hundreds of years before the Battle of Naboo, the Lontars invaded Batorine and nearly wiped out the Blood Carvers, who joined the Galactic Republic in 110 BBY. The survivors were taken to Coruscant, where they stayed in seclusion. By 29 BBY, there were only several hundred of them left on the planet. Blood Carvers also had a colony on Alderaan before its destruction. Blood Carvers exiled from Batorine sometimes gravitated to small pocket colonies of their own species, sometimes as remote as Nar Shaddaa and other Outer Rim worlds. Blood Carver in the Galaxy: On Batorine, Blood Carvers were fiercely loyal to their tribes. Those who ventured offworld projected that loyalty on their new companions. Except for exiles, Blood Carvers rarely traveled alone. They found flattery and excess alike offensive and usually disdained egoism or material wealth. Those showing hints of greed or pride were exiled from Batorine.",

      "name": "Bouncer",
      "plural": "Bouncers",
      "description": "Bouncer Bouncers were the native sentient species of Ruusan. Globe-like creatures, they received their name from their method of locomotion: propelled by the wind, they bounced themselves off obstacles to reach great heights. Their bodies were covered in green fur, and numerous tentacles grew from their body, of which half ended in delta shaped appendages capable of digging and writing in the ground. The Bouncers' homeworld was the location of a great battle between the forces of the Army of Light and the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars. The Bouncers tried to ease the struggles of both sides, bringing support and comfort to the dying using their mild telepathic abilities. When the conflict ended with Lord Kaan unleashing the thought bomb, trapping the spirits of hundreds of Jedi and Sith inside, the Bouncers maintained a prophecy that \"a Knight would come, a battle would be fought, and the prisoners go free.\" The Bouncers helped fulfill the prophecy when they guided the Jedi Kyle Katarn to the planet's Valley of the Jedi over a thousand years later. A Bouncer was also responsible for the survival of Rain, who went on to become the Sith Lord Darth Zannah. Biology & Appearance: The Bouncers were a species of sentient beings native to the planet Ruusan. They were shaped like medicine balls, and they appeared rather fragile. Their internal physiology was balloon-like, resulting in negligible weight. Their skin was leathery and warm and dry to the touch. They appeared only as green blobs when viewed under infra-red. Their skin was covered in green hair, which fluttered in the Ruusan breezes. Dominating the Bouncers' faces were two enormous luminous eyes. These had large pupils which were especially good for gathering light due to the species' nocturnal nature. Bouncers had no visible nose or mouth. From these globe shaped bodies, the Bouncers had numerous tentacles, half of which ended in delta shaped appendages. These functioned efficiently as small digging tools. The Bouncers were able to \"walk\" along the ground with these tentacles and could stand on them when gathered together. These tentacles were very dexterous and were used by the Bouncers to manipulate items, such as styluses. When bouncing, these tentacles often drifted behind, giving them a ghostly appearance. The Bouncers' primary method of locomotion relied on the wind. Due to their balloon-like bodies and negligible weight, they were easily carried by the winds. They were able to control their momentum and direction via specialized skin flaps that functioned as wind vanes. By turning, raising, and lowering these flaps, the Bouncers were able to control their direction. They aimed themselves at oncoming obstacles such as stones or boulders, and in this manner \"bounced;\" hence their name. Using that technique, they could achieve heights up to fifty or sixty meters. The larger Bouncers were even able to carry extra weight without it affecting their momentum. Through a combination of manipulation of their tentacles and friction against the sand, the Bouncers were able to brake. They then used their tentacles to anchor themselves to the ground against the winds. In that manner, tribes of Bouncers traveled across the plains and wastelands of Ruusan, tacking and wheeling as a group. Bouncers also enjoyed using their tentacles to climb large rock spurs, from which they flung themselves into the void, floating until gravity drew them to the ground. Their motion was considered by some to be dance-like, and for Morgan Katarn, epitomized freedom. While it is unclear whether the Bouncers were able to manipulate the Force, they were clearly able to feel it, and their presence did send out ripples through the Force. The Force also frequently gave them dreams and glimpses of the future. These were highly accurate, in both predicting the immediate future and more distant events. When passing on these oracles, however, they couched them in vague riddles and generalities. The dreams also incurred a cost; weak Bouncers could be killed by dark dreams. Society & Culture: The Bouncers' society maintained largely unchanged over the thousands of years of their existence. In 4 ABY, they still had a pre-industrial society, only numbering between 18,000 to 20,000 individuals. These were organized into tribes of around fifty to sixty, with an older Bouncer as leader. The Bouncers lived in the mountainous areas of their planet, and did not roam the deserts as was common for the Ruusanians. While Ruusan was once a temperate world with vast forests, after the explosion of Lord Kaan's thought bomb, the planet was largely arid wastelands. As such, the Bouncers made some adaptations to their behavioral patterns. Water became much scarcer as a consequence. To offset that, each morning, the Bouncers dug a series of shallow depressions into which they placed an inverted cone. These depressions were then covered with a thin, semitransparent tissue. These functioned as water stills, condensing moisture in the air and gathering it in the cone. In that manner, a supply of water awaited the Bouncers when they emerged at night. The Bouncers developed a number of herbal medicines and natural remedies for maladies they suffered. History: The Bouncers evolved on the planet Ruusan as the sole sentient species. The planet was eventually discovered by the Galactic Republic and as part of a wave of expansion throughout the newborn Teraab sector, it was settled by the Mining Guild. Deposits of iron, copper, cesium, iridium, nickel, and uranium dotted the planet, but proved to be less significant as those of neighboring planets such as Drogheda, Istic II, Pesmenben IV, and Tyne's Horky. As such, it was only sparsely settled, and the Bouncers co-existed peacefully with the various miners, farmers, and trappers. The planet gained unexpected importance during the New Sith Wars when it took on symbolic importance. Victory for the Sith would represent their inevitable advance, while liberation by the Republic would represent the Jedi's ability to defeat their sworn foes. That resulted in seven great battles on Ruusan, and innumerable skirmishes. The Bouncers did not take sides in the fight, but rather offered their unique assistance to both sides. Gifted with mild telepathy, the Bouncers visited the aftermaths of the battles, and projected images of succor and comfort to the surviving wounded. They became a welcome and familiar sight to both sides, as they aided in healing. However, that changed when the Sith forces began to use powerful dark side rituals to defeat the Jedi forces. Led by Darth Bane, the Sith unleashed an unnatural firestorm that destroyed huge swathes of forest, killing many Jedi in its flames, and forcing the others into exposed ground. The effect on the Bouncers was devastating. The raging fires killed most, and those that survived were driven mad by the cataclysm. Their ability to comfort was horribly distorted. They began to project terror, panic, and terrible nightmares to the sick and wounded. The Jedi were forced to kill the tormented beings in order to maintain their own morale. Only one Bouncer was spared the madness: Laa. Earlier, the old Bouncer had saved the life of a small Human girl. The girl, Rain, was a recruit for the Army of Light, but never reached them when the starship she was on was damaged by Sith Buzzards. Rain fell many meters from the ship, before Laa caught her in mid-air. Rain proved to be very strong in the Force, and instinctively protected Laa from the Sith firestorm. Laa's decision had significant consequences for the future of the Sith. In numerous prophetic dreams, Laa foresaw Rain becoming a powerful dark Jedi. Laa carried Rain on her back for many days until they came across some Jedi forces. Seeing only the Bouncer, the Jedi Petja shot and killed Laa. Instinctively, Rain responded, using the Force to snap the necks of the two Jedi. Ultimately, it was Laa's death that triggered Rain's turn to the dark side. The grieving child was found by Darth Bane, who took her as his apprentice. She eventually became Darth Zannah, a Dark Lord of the Sith. The larger conflict between the Jedi and Sith was concluded when Lord Kaan utilized another Sith ritual, known as the thought bomb. It created a receptacle for the dark side, which when detonated, sucked the spirits of all the proximate Jedi and Sith within its bounds. It effectively destroyed the Sith forces and large numbers of the Jedi force also, bringing an end to the war on Ruusan. The total effect on the Bouncers of the conflict was devastating. So many were killed by the indiscriminate Sith fires, the Jedi forces, and the thought bomb, that the species was pushed to the edge of extinction. Those that did survive were also faced with a different world, for the thought bomb had desolated much of the planet, transforming it into wastelands. Two of the Bouncers who did survive found Rain's cousin Darovit in the aftermath of these battles, speaking directly to his mind and strengthening his will to live after his hand was amputated. They led him to food and medical supplies, so that he could dress his wound and stave off infection. Over the next ten years, the Bouncers developed a particular fascination with Darovit. They taught him their herbal lore, and when he settled down in a hut, two or three Bouncers always circled his hut during the day and ventured out with him whenever he traveled. One such Bouncer was Yuun, who was accompanying Darovit when he discovered the Republic had returned to Ruusan in order to construct a monument to their fallen. Darovit tried to sabotage the project but to no avail. He eventually fought his cousin in a deadly duel, when Rain returned to the planet as a Sith Lord. The Republic monument became known as the Valley of the Jedi. Huge statues were erected of the fallen Jedi, as well as numerous tombs. While the memorial was popular for a time, within a decade the bickering Republic began to forget it. However, the Bouncers also made a record of these events, in what they called the \"Poem of Ages.\" The poem included a number of prophecies, including one regarding the Valley of the Jedi. The prophecy foretold of a Jedi Knight who would come to the planet, fight a battle, and free the prisoners trapped within the thought bomb. They preserved the prophecy for nearly a thousand years in which time it was also recorded offworld. Famous Bouncers: * Floater * Laa * Yuun",

They were often referred to by offworlders as the Cold Ones since it was easier to say than Brrbrlpp. They spoke a form of trinary via radio-waves which was taught to them by Commander Si of the Esfandia Long-Range Communications Base. The Brrbrlpp as a species were talkative and their calls could travel great distances. Like many other sentient species, Brrbrlpp youth were willing to risk death for excitement. Since Esfandia could not support a large and varied ecosystem, the species was never plentiful and during the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, it was estimated that there were several thousand Brrbrlpp. On Esfandia, the Brrbrlpp tend massive gardens and bred swarms of flying insects which they traded for trace minerals filtered from the air. Biology & Appearance: The Brrbrlpp were flower shaped amoeba like sentients. They rippled the outer edges of their bodies to provide motion and could move rather swiftly if necessary. A ring of photosensors studded its interior, they had radial lines of cilia, semi-transparent flesh and had a complicated skeleton to keep its \"petals\" rigid. Inside its body they had gently pulsating dark patches that could have been internal organs, they also had a long whip-like tail. The females laid eggs and the males would later fertilize them.

      "description": "Brubb Brubbs were reptilian bipeds from the planet Baros in the Baros system. To adapt to life on an arid world with frequent sandstorms, the ancestors of the Brubbs evolved thick skins and tough, transparent membranes over their eyes for protection. Since there was little to hear on Baros other than howling winds, Brubbs were nearly deaf. Brubbs were strong for their size (1.5 to 1.7 meters tall), due to their origins on a high-gravity world. Brubbs also had the limited ability to camouflage themselves by changing skin color, though the color range was only from yellow to a greenish-gray. Brubbs were a very social people, living in large communal groups called habas. Most habas were extended family groups which raised children communally and operated some specialized business together (like a farm, a mine, or even a vacation resort). Certain \"university\" habas, however, were drawn from the best and brightest of many habas. These groups had technology approaching galactic standard, especially in the areas of solar and wind power. According to Obo Rin's Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy, it was one of these university habas that first made contact with the outside galaxy, by beaming radio signals which eventually came to the attention of the Galactic Empire. Some evidence exists of earlier Brubb contact with other inhabited worlds, however. In 32 BBY, a cantina in Mos Espa on Tatooine was known as \"The Blue Brubb\". Each haba was governed by its ten oldest Brubbs. As female Brubbs had a lower life expectancy, due to the stress of egg-laying, the leaders were almost always male. At the same time that the Brubbs were dealing with first contact with aliens, many female Brubbs were arguing for an equal share in haba leadership, and protesting by refusing to lay eggs. Since Baros was a high-gravity world with few natural resources and low-tech natives, the Brubbs did not see much interstellar trade. Their main commodities were the Brubbs themselves—their strength and toughness made them prized mercenaries and laborers. Jabba the Hutt employed some Brubbs as guards on Khetanna, his sail barge. Other Brubbs, due to their sociable nature and interesting appearance, became \"ornamental\" beings hired as retainers for wealthy Core Worlders.",

The Buzchub enjoyed traveling the galaxy, using mechanical translators to communicate with other species. Shortly after the Battle of Endor, the Buzchub Und'l worked for sympathizers of the Galactic Empire, although he believed his employers were simply spice shippers. Biology & Appearance: The Buzchub were a sentient species covered in dark blue fur. They were stocky and had a wiry strength that was not immediately obvious. Each Buzchub had a round face with two round, lidded eyes; a stubby nose; and a broad mouth. Their vocal chords were physically incapable of speaking Galactic Basic Standard. The Buzchub had a waddling gait, and an individual could grow to 1.5 meters in height. Society & Culture: The Buzchub were a relatively peaceful species. They had an affinity for Wookiees, considering them to be their \"long-haired brothers.\" While incapable of speaking Basic, they could understand it, and spacefaring Buzchub utilized mechanical translators that they wore around the neck in order to communicate in the language. Some Buzchub, such as Und'l, spoke with a peculiar rhythm, using short, paired phrases. Buzchub were not overly curious about other species or technology, but they thoroughly enjoyed traveling the galaxy. History: The Buzchub were believed to be native to Harrandarr, a planet in the remote Bosph sector of the Outer Rim Territories. In the period following the Battle of Endor of 4 ABY, the Buzchub Und'l traveled the galaxy. He began working for people he believed to be spice shippers, but who were in fact sympathizers of the Galactic Empire. For these employers, Und'l made contact with a group of smugglers on the planet Roldalna, arranging for them to ship spice from Nigel VI to Lohopa II in exchange for 25,000. In truth, the cargo was lexonite, a deadly poison used by Imperial terrorist groups.",

Biology & Appearance: Caamasi had a spicy, woody body scent that was similar to that of Corellian whiskey. They had long arms with thin, three-fingered hands. They also had extremely acute senses of smell. Caamasi had the interesting ability to share vivid memories called memnii with their near relatives and Jedi. A memnis was as vivid to one who received it as it was to the one participated in the event remembered. History: Caamasi possessed great moral strength and respect for others. They were among the galaxy's finest diplomats and mediators, often solving severe conflicts in a matter of days. Senior Anthropologist Hoole witnessed the Caamasis' prowess firsthand when they negotiated peace between the Kubaz and the Verpine. Unfortunately, the Caamasis' pacifism was at odds with Emperor Palpatine's New Order, and they suffered greatly under Imperial rule. A few months after the end of the Clone Wars, the surface of their homeworld, Caamas was bombarded, killing millions. After the destruction of their planet's environment, many refugees moved to Alderaan, Kerilt and Susevfi. The bombardment was aided by a group of Bothans who sabotaged Caamas' shield generators. The Caamas Document detailed their involvement. Although many demanded that the Bothans purchase an uninhabited planet and terraform it according to Caamas' specifications, the Caamasi chose to forgive those who had betrayed them. It was said in ancient legend that at the dawning of their age of existence, the Jedi came to the Caamasi for instruction on how to dictate the moral use of their powers, which could explain why the teachings of the Jedi Code have a great deal in common with the oft-inherent wisdom of the Caamasi, and perhaps another reason Palpatine felt it necessary to eliminate them.

Biology & Appearance: The species typically displayed broad grins, bearing a double row of flat, wide, and perfectly white teeth. Because of their native habitat, the species was well-suited for surviving in hot climates. Since extreme cold was unknown to this species, their ability to survive in such environments was hindered more than most species. Personality: They were typically sly, ingratiating beings with an eye for profit. Their penchant for crooked business dealings was regularly cloaked by their friendly demeanor. This caused them to suffer from a poor reputation though, making outsider trust of the species a rare thing. When dealing with large groups of individuals directly, their charm was often described as \"child-like,\" exemplifying their guise of innocence. They were often described as \"friendly, entertaining, and humorous.\" Every Caarite knew the native Caarimala language, Galactic Basic, and at least one other language. Communication was considered a fundamental skill for their society. This was especially true as the species favors nonviolent means of dealing with an adversary in a face-to-face encounter. Caarites were occasionally Force Sensitive, though their inherent greed prevented them from truly embracing the ways of the Jedi. History: The Caarites were members of the Trade Federation. When the Federation blockaded Naboo, the Caarites were convinced it would cause the end of the Federation, so convinced the Filordi to split off with them in forming the Metatheran Cartel. Of the two member species of the Cartel, the Caarites served as the public face. As the Caarites were well-known in the Cularin system, the alien ever-smiling crew of the local Dorumaa Resort were jokingly known as \"Neo-Caarites\", even though they were Gungans, Humans and Twi'leks.

By Galactic standards, Calians were primitive and did not understand Basic; however, they did have repulsorcraft and blasters.

However, a few Calians such as Jain Havero had blond hair and a peach-colored complexion, which made them stand among the crowd. On top of that, a vast majority of Calians were slender and muscular. Society & Culture: Contrary to many other Human cultures, the people of Shiva IV carried very little in the way of personal equipment. The Calians did not wear many layers and pieces of cloth. All males wore a type of harness that left most of their chest exposed and a knee-length loincloth attached at the waist by an ornated belt. Both sexes were fond of jewelry and ornaments. Males are clean shaven and wear their hair short, while females wore them long.

They also had a reputation of being better with words than with acts, something that not even the Calibops themselves argued. A number of Calibops were seen in the galaxy, including Chief of State Ponc Gavrisom of the New Republic, Sergeant at Arms Mif Kumas and a member of Boba Fett's Mandalorian Protectors. Biology & Appearance: A Calibop was a tall avian sentient. At least one Calibop had pale blue eyes. A Calibop also had a mane of feathers that the individual could shake, sometimes indicating an easygoing criticism. A Calibop had a big beak that could be used to whinny in the species' equivalent to a sigh, or to expel sounds created in the depths of the Calibop's throat. A Calibop had a robust voice generated in the beak. Calibops had big wings that did not allow them to fly, but an individual could flutter them to increase his walking speed. The wings could be folded either in front or behind the person, and were strong enough to be used in melee combat. The tips of the wings were prehensile like fingers. Calibops used these as fingers to press keys, or to flicker restlessly. Calibops also had tails that they could flicker in what was considered the Calibop version of a shrug. Society & Culture: The Calibops had a reputation of being particularly rhetoric, even if it detracted their skill for other activities seen as more active. The Calibops themselves were familiar with their stigma, but many of them believed that words were useful at certain times, even if only actions could be useful at other times. History: The Calibops were known in the galaxy from at least 18 ABY. At that point, the Calibops were considered sentients. A Human from the Galactic Empire could shake hands with a Calibop. Calibop in the Galaxy: A notorious Calibop in the galaxy was Ponc Gavrisom, Chief of State of the New Republic from 18 ABY to 21 ABY, and signatory of the Bastion Accords of 19 ABY that marked an official ending to the Galactic Civil War. Another Calibop, Mif Kumas, was Sergeant at Arms of the Galactic Senate from 21 ABY to 27 ABY, when the august body was dissolved.

In fact, the Caridans were widely known for their appraisal and bartering skills. The Caridans cooperated with the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire in the operation of the Academy of Carida. The Empire's xenophobia ignored the Caridans outside the Imperial compound, although tensions grew after the Battle of Yavin. Many Caridans vanished from the galaxy with the destruction of Carida at the hand of Kyp Durron. The few Caridans that survived were off-world as traders, New Republic operatives or fringers. Notable Caridans included Imperial Ambassador Furgan of Carida. Biology & Appearance: Caridans average well over 2 meters in height, with long eyebrows and three-fingered hands. Their long, spindly looking legs are composed almost entirely of wiry muscle and end in two-toed, semi-hoofed feet. Caridans in the Galaxy: Few Caridans ever left their homeworld before its destruction, though a few traveling Caridan merchants may yet survive in the galaxy at large, and a few more survive within the ranks of the New Republic military.",

      "name": "Carosite",
      "plural": "Carosites",
      "description": "Carosite Carosites were a mammalian sentient species who hailed from the planet Carosi IV. However, when the star Carosi began to rapidly expand, they were forced to evacuate their entire population to the outer planet Carosi XII and rebuild their civilization. Carosites were renowned throughout the galaxy for their medical skills. Their medical academies attracted some of the galaxy's greatest doctors to study and teach, drawn by their significant advancements in the treatment of mental illnesses and in medical droid technology. Carosites were generally pacifists, although on occasion they flew into berserker rages to protect their patients. Their reverence for life and medical acumen culminated in their famous hospital ship, the Sudden Restoration. Throughout the Galactic Civil War it provided free health care to all, without regard to political affiliation. Biology & Appearance: Carosites were a species of sentient, humanoid mammals, standing between 1.3 and 1.7 meters tall. Their heads, on unusually long necks, sported long snouts and small beady eyes. Carosites were slim in build and had extremely nimble hands due to the peculiar arrangement of their digits; two opposable thumbs flanked three central fingers. Their bodies were covered in short, fine fur that kept them warm, and they often grew long goatees on their chins. Carosites had particularly acute senses. Carosites could only reproduce twice in their lifetimes, on each occasion producing a litter of up to six young. Families were the only social unit in their communities, and often included older relatives unable to live independently. The Carosite lifespan was 120 standard years. Society & Culture: Healing & Medicine: Due to their infrequent reproduction, the Carosites developed a great reverence for life; each being's life was regarded as sacred. The attitude influenced their society in numerous ways, most particularly in their strong medical tradition. They made advances in the recognition and treatment of mental illnesses, with their sanitariums known for their emphasis on healing the individual rather than confinement. They also made innovations in the field of medical droid programming. As such, upgrading medical droids on the planet Carosi XII cost only a fraction of what it did elsewhere. To maintain their medical facilities, the Carosites traded heavily with the Ebranites for lu-ramin, an oil vital for several of their medicines. Carosites charged for their healing services commensurate to the patients' ability to pay. One distinctive feature of their care was their refusal to install cybernetic enhancements, but they were willing to install prosthetics which did not enhance patients' abilities. Carosites enjoyed passing on their medical heritage, so medical academies were established on their planet, such as the Carosi XII Academy of Medicine. These institutions attracted famous doctors, scientists, and surgeons to study or teach. The Carosite language was influenced by such heritage, with medical metaphors commonly used to describe business deals, galactic politics, and other non-medical areas of life. Their reverence for life produced a strongly pacifist culture, although an exception was made for the protection of the feeble, the helpless, and their patients. Under such circumstances, Carosites were known to fly into a berserker state, sometimes called a \"life-saving fanaticism.\" Furthermore, the Carosites abhorred any form of interrogation or brainwashing, regarding private thoughts as inviolate. However, a vocal minority argued for more aggressive action against oppressors such as the Galactic Empire. This group called themselves \"The Preventers,\" and argued that assertive action would save lives in the long run. The Carosites were aware of the Force, and desired to learn more about it. However, no Carosite was ever trained as a Jedi, as their curiosity revolved around using it to promote healing and recovery, rather than for other purposes. Their attitude toward the Force was typical of the innovative species, some of whom even tried to find ways to harness blaster technology to promote healing. Government: The Carosites developed a form of democracy whereby every ten years they elected a leader who held absolute authority. This leader relied on eleven counselors for advice, selected from the species' eleven major families. Carosite society valued truth, and so considered verbal and written agreements completely binding. As a manifestation of their eternal optimism, they extended this expectation to offworlders, who frequently abused such trust and failed to uphold their bargains. Carosites disliked alcohol due to its harmful effects on sentients, both in the short and the long term. The disdain led their government to tax liquor sales heavily and minimize the number of liquor outlets on their planet. Their paternalistic attitude led Carosites to frequently offer unsolicited dietary advice. Visitors often regarded such doting as worse than that typical of protocol droids. The sole city on Carosi XII was Newlife Point, which was home to most of the two million Carosites living on the planet. The city was established on the shores of the Avuae sea, where the original refugee ships had landed. The sea was rich in marine life, which provided a good source of protein, and the Carosites were fond of swimming in the icy waters. Just south of this city were a number of hot pools, heated by underground volcanic activity. The hot springs were known to aid in the healing process and so the Carosites linked it to Newlife Point with an underground transrail system. History: The Carosite species originally evolved on the planet Carosi IV in the Carosus system, part of the Nembus sector of the Outer Rim Territories. However, in 200 BBY, their sun began an unusually rapid expansion that threatened their homeworld. The situation led to a major upheaval in Carosite society, and over the course of twenty years, they evacuated their entire civilization to Carosi XII, an ice planet further out in the system. The expanding sun consumed the first five planets of the system and soon increased the temperature of Carosi XII to merely \"cool,\" rendering the world more hospitable. The Carosites slowly terraformed Carosi XII over the next two centuries, making use of scientists and other specialists to rebuild their world. The Carosites were deeply affected by their turbulent dislocation and struggled to find their bearing in the galaxy for many generations. It caused many to value old traditions and rituals, producing a veneration of the past. However, a small fragment of their society pushed for the forging of new traditions to meet their new circumstances. This caused heated debate among the population. During the Galactic Civil War, the Carosites were loyal to the Rebel Alliance, but their respect for life led them to be undiscerning in whom they treated, prompting Carosite physicians to provide medical care for Imperial survivors as much as Rebels. The Carosites had little military strength and maintained only a small navy and merchant fleet. In 0 ABY, the Alliance made a significant strike against the Empire in the Carosus system. After the Rebel Alliance transitioned into the New Republic, the Carosite relationship with the government was further strengthened by Omo Taj, the Carosite leader at the time. He authorized the construction of a secret base on Carosi XII, and he subsequently maintained good relations with the base commander, Balderik Rajana. However, the base did draw Imperial attention to Carosi XII. On one such occasion, an agent trained rinacats, native predators, to hunt the base operatives. Later during the New Republic era, the Carosites established pleasure domes on Carosi XII, some making use of expensive synthdroids, which increased travel to the planet such that the starport was in constant use. The Loronar Corporation established a synthdroid factory on the moon of Carosi XII, which was visited by Chief of State Leia Organa. Carosites in the Galaxy: Carosites were most frequently encountered in the galaxy as physicians and doctors, such as the pair that worked as medics at the Galactic Outdoor Survival School. A notable Carosite physician was Tamo Lan. Trained in medicine on Carosi XII, Lan joined the Rebel Alliance after killing a Twi'lek who threatened one of his patients. He served the Alliance on Baes Logia and the Massassi Temple on Yavin 4 before joining Shroud Team as a medic. When his best friend, the Aqualish Karlon, was killed on Bresnia, he took in Karlon's sister, Gondara. Not all Carosites were so selfless; the cyberneticist Dr. Parnath was a notorious exception. Exiled from Carosi for his unethical practices and relentless pursuit of credits, he moved to the Vergesso Asteroids where he performed any cybernetic enhancements requested of him, provided the payment was good. Even more prominent than these individuals were the Carosite physicians aboard the hospital ship the Sudden Restoration. A modified Kuat Drive Yards HS-1 hospital ship Class C Frigate, it traveled the galaxy providing free medical care to all, and acquired a legendary patient recovery rate. It was given its name because it often visited the sites of recent battles, appearing out of nowhere to care for the wounded and civilian populations. The ship's reputation was tarnished somewhat when one of its physicians was blackmailed by the Empire into serving as their agent. He was putting Republic officers into comatose states and then jettisoning their \"dead\" bodies into space, where the Imperials later picked them up for interrogation. The Sudden Restoration offered medical care to the sick and wounded, regardless of their political affiliations. Because of this liberal approach, it was largely free from attack, with pirates known to hunt down any who dared menace the ship. However, on one occasion the ship was attacked by a bounty hunter. He had been hired by a crime lord to assassinate an Imperial officer who was receiving treatment on the ship. Afterward, the New Republic insisted on stationing X-wings aboard to provide small fighter cover to the ship. The ship was so successful that the Carosites considered producing more like it. Many of its patients were later transferred to Carosi Alpha Hospital on Carosi XII itself. The Sudden Restoration was open to different methods of healing, and for a time the Ewok shaman Keoulkeech served aboard it. A Carosite transport on its way to Yir Tangee had encountered the Ewok while on a stopover at Salfur's Trading Post on Endor. Recognizing his ability, they had transferred him to the Sudden Restoration. During the Galactic Civil War, the Empire captured a Carosite smuggler. Darth Vader then used the dark side of the Force to burn his mind, transforming him into a feral beast, driven by fear, and used him as a fanatical guard. In 12 ABY, New Republic agents Han Solo and Chewbacca encountered him on Belsavis in the underground catacombs.",

Biology & Appearance: Celegians appeared to many humanoids as \"floating brains.\" Very intelligent, they had a natural form of telekinesis that functioned like a repulsorlift. They breathed cyanogen, a gas poisonous to Humans. Conversely, oxygen was lethal to them, necessitating atmospheric transport chambers offworld. The Celegians were greatly known for their massive intellect and wisdom. Their race evolved from ocean-dwelling invertebrates to the ancestors that eventually lived on land in Celegia. To move their jellyfish-like bodies, the Celegians created a form of locomotion similar to a repulsorlift generator. Their soft fleshy bodies, great tentacles, and dependence upon life-support chambers made the Celegians look as though they were always swimming or floating. Celegians communicated using a form of telepathy, and had no written or spoken language. Celegians tended to be explorers, and were often found in the company of other species with the same interests. Those Celegians that could be encountered away from their homeworld were usually scouts or diplomats, although a rare few were trained in the ways of the Force.

      "description": "Cha'a The Cha'a were a small, orange-scaled, reptilian species, known for their cunning natures. They were part of galactic society for many thousands of years. One of the most famous Cha'a was the Merchant Lord, Ssk Kahorr, who lived during the Great Hyperspace War. Other notable Cha'a included three Jedi students who trained alongside Jacen and Jaina Solo in the New Jedi Order. Biology & Appearance: The Cha'a were a delicately scaled, reptilian species, of predominatly orange coloration. Above their wide-set, slitted eyes, a line of horns ran along the top of their heads and continued down their backs. They had long snouts with sharp teeth and a long, dexterous, tongue. The Cha'a were carnivorous, using their sharp teeth to consume live wabbas shortly after they hatched. These teeth were sometimes also used against Cha'a hatchling-mates, determining the dominant members of each clutch of eggs. The Cha'a were bipedal, with each limb ending in three clawed digits. Society & Culture: The Cha'a were a technically proficient species, designing starships, such as the Cha'a drone ships, and droids, such as the message pod. The design of their drone ships was distinctive, with large ornate figureheads integrated into the design. One such ship was the Zeta Five, which was destroyed on an untested hyperspace route that passed too close to the star, Primus Goluud. History: The Cha'a were active in galactic life from the times of the early Galactic Republic. Spread across the galaxy, Cha'a were known to live on urban worlds such as Empress Teta and well as the mining colony of Goluud Minor. One powerful Cha'a in that era was Ssk Kahorr, head of a trading fleet of drone ships. As a representative of his species, Kahorr was a ambitious individual, willing to take risks in his business, such as using the newly found Goluud Corridor hyperlane to access the mining colony. When the route proved unstable and destroyed his cargo-ship Zeta Five, he had the Hyperspace Navigator's Guild representative Shodon Ko killed and paid bounty hunters to hunt down the route's discovers, Dav and Jori Daragon. Kahorr later confiscated the Daragon's starship, Starbreaker 12, and was killed when it was destroyed by the arrival of a Sith armada in the opening salvo of the Great Hyperspace War. The Cha'a continued to be part of the galactic community into the administration of the New Republic, where three Cha'a hatchling-mates underwent training at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. They helped defend the Praxeum from an assault by the Second Imperium, an Imperial-aligned darksider training facility, by hiding in the murky jungle rivers to ambush Dark Jedi. As a species, Cha'a were also targeted by the Diversity Alliance as possible recruits. Shistavanen, Adjunctant Advisor Hovrak identified them as being wily, and ambitious, traits beneficial to the Alliance; however, the Alliance was defeated shortly after Hovrak's voiced his recruitment aim.",

      "name": "Chagrian",
      "plural": "Chagrians",
      "description": "Chagrian Chagrians were a sentient species of amphibious humanoids native to the water planet of Champala. Biology & Appearance: The average Chagrian stood taller than a Human with blue skin ranging in tone from light blue to indigo. They were distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they called lethorns. As they aged, the lethorns would thicken. Males also sported two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and were seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lacked the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates. These could reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also had very long black forked tongues. Chagrians were truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possessed acute low-light vision. Because of frequent exposure to Champala's oceans, Chagrians lost their sense of taste by adulthood. As a result they regarded eating as an unfortunate nuisance rather than something to be looked forward to and enjoyed. As they had little interest in eating Chagrians consumed nutritional substances to replace meals. They carried sensors designed to scan for maximum nutritional value when forced to eat actual food. Chagrians had a natural resistance to radiation. This dated back to a period of solar instability coinciding with the early evolution of life on Champala. The entire star system was bombarded with intense radiation, and only those lifeforms most able to withstand the bombardment survived. Society & Culture: Chagrians were born as tadpoles in clutches of three or more, and raised in tubs of water in a family's private home. During this time, their arms, legs, and air-breathing lungs were developed. As a species, Chagrians were generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. There was no sense of greed and Chagrians were only motivated by basic desires such as food, shelter, and health-care. Champalan government ensured that every citizen was cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian was high compared to the members of other species. Education was valued in Chagrian society and many Chagrians would travel off-world for advanced university studies. Most Champala-based Chagrians did not speak Basic, however those who travel off-world learned it quickly. Many Chagrians believed the god-king Aram Acheron would one day burst forth from Logue Rock and lead his faithful to victory over their enemies. During times of war, Chagrians would wear red. History: Civilization on Champala originated in long strips of coastline, where sea levels fluctuated wildly with the tides. Buildings in these ancient cities were entirely submerged at high tide, and Chagrians swam between them. Some multi-story buildings were not equipped with staircases or elevators at all; inhabitants simply waited until high tide, then swam to higher floors. Once the Chagrians made contact with other species, they constructed starports and trade cities on high plateaus accessible by aircar. C. 529 BBY, a number of needy Chagrian locals were approached by recruiters sent by Hugo Bartyn. Bartyn wanted amphibian fishermen to settle a new city in Lamaredd and tempted these poverty-stricken individuals with promises of untouched seas in a new frontier. Once they arrived, however, they became slave laborers. A few years later, one of these Chagrians, Sirrik Olyeg, founded the Sailor's Union and was responsible of the liberation of all the slaves. During the Galactic Civil War, many Chagrians were moved to join the Rebel Alliance. They applied their aquatic expertise to the liberation of Imperial-dominated water worlds and played a major role in liberating Mon Calamari. Champala was one of the first planets to join the Alliance of Free Planets, and later the New Republic, and remained a staunch supporter. Chagrians in the galaxy had many different occupations. Mas Amedda served as Chancellor Palpatine's right-hand man during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Sul Dekkon was a Chagrian lawyer who prosecuted the ex-Jedi Tahiri Veila in 44 ABY as one of his most famous court cases. Some Chagrians in Lamaredd obtain certain notoriety, including Sirrik Olyeg; \"Bantha\" Burloo, a large Chagrian bouncer at Miss Mylla's Saloon; and Ackrahbala, also known as \"Crazy 'Bala\", the manager and owner of Ackrahbala's Swoops & Speeders.

      "description": "Charon Charon were a sentient species with both humanoid and arachnoid features. They had four arms, two of which were extremely powerful, and four legs, which made them very stable on their feet. Originally from a realm known as realspace, the Charon moved to a cold, bleak planet located in \"otherspace,\" a pocket dimension made up of black holes beyond the known confines of the galaxy. Charon were known for their violent, emotionless nature. Prior to the rise of the New Jedi Order, Charon were confined to otherspace, where most Charon followed a death cult which held the existence of all life, even their own species, to be an abomination. Their contact with the civilizations of the galaxy was limited, but it was enough to make them objects of horror. Shortly after the destruction of the second Death Star in 4 ABY, a splinter group of Charon devoted to maintaining peace and setting up new communities successfully constructed the species’ first hyperdrive and departed otherspace, with many Charon taking up positions as bioscientists, developing bio-organic technology similar to that of the Yuuzhan Vong. Biology & Appearance: Averaging between two to two and a quarter meters tall, Charon resembled a biological cross between humanoids and arachnids. They had thin bodies, encased by a thick mottled carapace, with distinctly arachnoid features, such as spinnerets in the abdomen, as well as multiple limbs. They had four thin arms with triple-clawed hands, and four hairy, insectoid legs, with large clawed feet. Their uppermost pair of arms was slightly larger than the other pair, and was used for holding weapons, and although Charon could hold objects in any of their four clawed hands, they only had one pair of primary hands. Their multiple limbs had several advantages; Charon were exceptional climbers, were extremely stable on their feet, and the claws on both their hands and feet made deadly weapons capable of damaging almost any material. An extremely powerful species, they were also able to lift objects which were far too heavy for most other species. Charon had mandibular chelicerae at the sides of their small mouths and bulging, slit-pupil eyes. They often wore clothing from the waist up, though not always. Because of their large size, Charon found it difficult to hide, although they could move slightly faster than most other species. Charon had a large trailing abdomen, capable of spinning strands of sticky webbing, which could be organized into latticework structures that allowed Charon to climb from place to place. They could shoot webs several times a day; the stronger the individual Charon the more times it could spin. They were able to attack an enemy over ten meters away with a strand of webbing, entangling them, or spin a web about two meters around them in all directions. Although it could be broken by blunt objects, blasters and lightsabers were the most effective weapons against a Charon’s webbing. Charon had shorter lifespans than most sentient species in the known galaxy, growing rapidly in the first half dozen standard years of their lives. Considered younglings until they were four standard years old, Charon became adults at six standard years. When they reached thirty four years, they were regarded as middle-aged, while those between fifty six and sixty four were thought to be old. A Charon who lived for more than sixty five years old was considered venerable. Society & Culture: After the Cult of the Void gained complete power over the Charon people, their leader, the Prophet of the Void, became the supreme dictator of all of otherspace, and his orders were followed without question. Charon who served the Prophet of the Void believed in entropy, and strove to destroy all life without mercy. During the reign of the Cult, Charon were thought to be emotionless beings with a lust for death, and they believed the free will exhibited by other species was blasphemy. Those Charon who defected to the Cult of Light followed the Illuminated One devotedly, and sought to leave their galaxy and create a new, thriving colony of Charon on a more hospitable planet. All Charon, regardless of affiliation and allegiance, were ruthless and extremely determined, pursuing their desires with single-minded determination. Those who had encountered the Charon simply thought they were intelligent killing machines. Considered evil by the few spacers in the Outer Rim with any knowledge of them, Charon terrified all sentients they came into contact with, and were extremely powerful and aggressive. All Charon technology was based on biological constructs, and although they did not shun or despise mechanical technology, they preferred bio-organics. The process by which these bio-organic materials were created was unknown, however one theory put forward by Imperial sentientologists was that Charon bioscientists surgically modified living beings to create an organic machine that fitted their wants and needs. An alternative theory was that their constructs were genetically engineered, or else a combination of the two possible methods. Although the constructs were essentially living beings, they were said to have no personality or free will. The amount of bio-organics produced by the Charon dropped significantly when the Charon began to slaughter the other beings of their galaxy. Charon spoke a bizarre language of the same name, made up of clicks, squeals and various scratching sounds made by rubbing their mandibles together. The language could only be copied by other insectoid species. Written Charon was basically a series of intricate web patterns indistinguishable from decorative shapes. Although at least one prophet took a name, Charon serving the Prophet of the Void were never given personal names. Charon belonging to the Cult of Light often took on names while exploring the Galaxy; the names they took were usually influenced by the other species which they had met on their travels. Common Charon names included Fa’chak, H’zish, Ry’shyrr, Sya’kalla and Tin’soth. In addition to two castes, Charon produced biotechnological constructs which incorporated Charon and alien biological components. They may also have had additional, rarer castes. Warriors: This caste looked like eight legged spiders with dark exo-skeletons, allowing them stealthy movement in dark locations. It was this caste that served the cause of the Charon by killing millions in their native dimension. Warriors usually stood upright, and were typically males. Bioscientists: This caste was smaller than their counterparts with brightly colored cilia on their forelegs, this caste was slower but far more agile than the warriors. This caste was populated by scientists who had mastered the creation of biological constructs which lacked the free will and vitality of other lifeforms. Bioscientists were typically females, and unlike warriors, they wore uniforms. Bioscientists were bred to think in longer term goals than their warrior counterparts, and carried medprobes, diagnostic scanners, plasma scalpels and neuro-replacement chips. History: Though most commonly associated with otherspace, the Charon actually originated in realspace. Their precursors were the Charr Ontee of Kathol, sentient arachnoids genetically engineered by the Precursors of Kathol as agricultural workers. After the Rift Disaster, many Charr Ontee ships were \"flipped\" into otherspace. The Charr Ontee stranded in otherspace found a new home, and eventually gave rise to the Charon. Their new home system was close to a black hole, which threatened to drag their homeworld into its gravitational clutches. Due to its proximity to a black hole, the new planet of the Charon was cold, dark and barely habitable, for the gravity of black holes was so great that it could even suck light into it. Only the Charon knew the exact location of their world, and no-one ever learned its name. In the face of imminent destruction, a death-worshiping religion arose. The Charon Death Cult, or Cult of Death, held that as all life must eventually return to the Void of Death, it was the holy duty of the Charon to speed all life towards this end. All life, including the Charon themselves, was viewed as blasphemy. They were led by the Prophet of the Void. Shortly before the death cult became influential on their home planet, a stardrive was developed by the Charon. Instead of utilizing it to escape their doomed world, the Charon death worshipers annihilated their home planet and all non-believers, and used the stardrive to disperse throughout Otherspace, exterminating any lifeform they came across. As they spread through their galaxy, the Charon massacred and eradicated all life they came into contact with. However, the Charon never discovered the secret of hyperspace travel, and could never leave otherspace. Imperial sentientologists later stated that if the Charon death worshipers had discovered hyperspace, the consequences on the Empire’s galaxy would be severe, and that a war far more devastating than the Galactic Civil War may have broken out. Charon technology was based on specially grown organisms rather than machines or computers. Despite this, the Charon had no objection to using mechanical or electronic devices when available. Standard Charon technology did not include hyperdrives, however, thus confining the species for the most part to Otherspace. Examples of this unique biotechnology were stored in Emperor Palpatine's secret Mount Tantiss facility on the planet Wayland. Just prior to the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, a Charon splinter group calling themselves the Cult of Light secretly constructed the Charon’s first ever hyperdrive. Many Charon, disillusioned with the savage ways of the Cult of the Void, left the Charon Galaxy to find a new life. Each new hyperdrive produced gave hope to hundreds of Charon eager to escape otherspace, and the Cult of Light, which sought to mingle with other species and maintain peace, began to search for uninhabited worlds to colonize and transport Charon to. The Cult of Light, led by a Charon dubbed the Illuminated One, managed to remain secret from the Cult of the Void until the destruction of Coruscant by the Yuuzhan Vong in 27 ABY. The Prophet of the Void then began to hunt down suspected members of the other faction; however, the Cult of Light were able to keep the secret of hyperspace out of the death worshipers clutches, thus saving the galaxy from another costly invasion. Charon in the Galaxy: Though the lack of hyperdrive technology restricted them for the most part to Otherspace, Charon were not unknown in realspace. Incidents of contact were rare enough that as late as the Galactic Civil War, Charon were considered little more than legends. Most of the information on them was gathered from spacer's tales and rumors in cantinas by Imperial sentientologist Obo Rin on behalf of Darth Vader. However, a group of Rebel operatives, as well as a group of Imperial prisoners of war led by Grand Moff Ravik, encountered the Charon and their Prophet, Ber'asco. This encounter eventually led to the Battle of Stronghold. Another small colony of Charon, consisting of less than three dozen warriors and bioscientists stranded in the galaxy after an unexplained accident was found on Kayri III around the same time. This colony had a Force-dampening sacred artifact called the Void Stone. Famous Charon really only existed in the Cult of Light, though a few Charon made allies with other species, mainly acting as bioscientists and warriors. Charon bioscientists constructed weapons, ships, and various other devices from living matter similarly to the Yuuzhan Vong, although no in depth study on their methods ever took place. No Force-using Charon were ever known to exist. Charon members of the Cult of the Light sought to discover and build colonies on uninhabited worlds. Ber'asco was a Charon Prophet of the Void, and the commander of the Charon ship Desolate. A mature Charon, he stood over almost meter taller than the average Charon. He wore a natural body armor constructed for him by his bioscientists, and he led the campaign to eradicate the last remaining life in otherspace, dubbing himself the Final Prophet. After extinguishing the last few lives of otherspace, Ber'asco and his Charon warriors captured a stranded rebel ship and learned of another dimension, teeming with life; he made it his goal to annihilate all life there too. With the help of Imperial Grand Moff Ravik, Ber'asco entered realspace, despite the efforts of the Rebel Alliance. When Ber'asco linked with the ship's computer, Ravik's mind entered the Charon's body. In order to survive, Ber'asco took the body of a young Human male named Bane Nothos, and helped the Alliance fight off Ravik and the Charon warriors. Ber'asco, using Nothos's body, later fought with Ravik, and was killed, although he managed to deal a fatal blow to the Moff inhabiting his body.",

Each new hyperdrive produced gave hope to hundreds of Charon eager to escape otherspace, and the Cult of Light, which sought to mingle with other species and maintain peace, began to search for uninhabited worlds to colonize and transport Charon to. The Cult of Light, led by a Charon dubbed the Illuminated One, managed to remain secret from the Cult of the Void until the destruction of Coruscant by the Yuuzhan Vong in 27 ABY. The Prophet of the Void then began to hunt down suspected members of the other faction; however, the Cult of Light were able to keep the secret of hyperspace out of the death worshipers clutches, thus saving the galaxy from another costly invasion. Charon in the Galaxy: Though the lack of hyperdrive technology restricted them for the most part to Otherspace, Charon were not unknown in realspace. Incidents of contact were rare enough that as late as the Galactic Civil War, Charon were considered little more than legends. Most of the information on them was gathered from spacer's tales and rumors in cantinas by Imperial sentientologist Obo Rin on behalf of Darth Vader. However, a group of Rebel operatives, as well as a group of Imperial prisoners of war led by Grand Moff Ravik, encountered the Charon and their Prophet, Ber'asco. This encounter eventually led to the Battle of Stronghold. Another small colony of Charon, consisting of less than three dozen warriors and bioscientists stranded in the galaxy after an unexplained accident was found on Kayri III around the same time. This colony had a Force-dampening sacred artifact called the Void Stone. Famous Charon really only existed in the Cult of Light, though a few Charon made allies with other species, mainly acting as bioscientists and warriors. Charon bioscientists constructed weapons, ships, and various other devices from living matter similarly to the Yuuzhan Vong, although no in depth study on their methods ever took place. No Force-using Charon were ever known to exist. Charon members of the Cult of the Light sought to discover and build colonies on uninhabited worlds. Ber'asco was a Charon Prophet of the Void, and the commander of the Charon ship Desolate. A mature Charon, he stood over almost meter taller than the average Charon. He wore a natural body armor constructed for him by his bioscientists, and he led the campaign to eradicate the last remaining life in otherspace, dubbing himself the Final Prophet. After extinguishing the last few lives of otherspace, Ber'asco and his Charon warriors captured a stranded rebel ship and learned of another dimension, teeming with life; he made it his goal to annihilate all life there too. With the help of Imperial Grand Moff Ravik, Ber'asco entered realspace, despite the efforts of the Rebel Alliance. When Ber'asco linked with the ship's computer, Ravik's mind entered the Charon's body. In order to survive, Ber'asco took the body of a young Human male named Bane Nothos, and helped the Alliance fight off Ravik and the Charon warriors. Ber'asco, using Nothos's body, later fought with Ravik, and was killed, although he managed to deal a fatal blow to the Moff inhabiting his body.",

This made them the eternal enemies of the Darkstryder construct, living far from the creature's fortress on the Kathol homeworld. This time apart allowed them to develop their own culture and society but they gradually discovered a terrible secret from their origins. They had learned that on a genetic level the species was degenerating, but this did not affect them learning to use the Ta-Ree life energy and they became quite adept in its usage.

      "description": "Type: Genetically altered reptilian slave race Chazrach The Chazrach (also known as \"reptoids\") were a short, stocky, reptilian humanoid race with snubbed snouts who served the Yuuzhan Vong as slave soldiers. With no mind of their own, the Chazrach are one of possibly many slave races that the Yuuzhan Vong use in combat situations. They have been altered as to be stronger and more aggressive than how they would normally be. Physically, Chazrach resemble small, bipedal lizards withe greyish-green skin. They are controlled with the same restraint growths used on thralls, and have been known to run amok when a nearby assault vehicle was destroyed. Overview: Like the Yuuzhan Vong, the Chazrach were not native to the galaxy, having been enslaved during the Yuuzhan Vong's conquest of their galaxy. Unlike the Yuuzhan Vong, however, they had a presence in the Force. For thousands of years, the Chazrach were bred in large numbers as expendable support troops. A pair of dome-like calcifications protruded from the forehead of each Chazrach, inhibiting their autonomy and allowing their Yuuzhan Vong masters to control them. However, this proved to be a disadvantage in battle since they could be easily killed. In battle, the Chazrach were controlled by warbeasts such as Thrall herders and Rakamats. If a warbeast was destroyed, the Chazrach associated with it would attack anything that moved, including each other. Any form of cognizance and initiative that was possessed by the base species vanished over the generations of genetic tampering by the shaper caste. This flaw, combined with their small, stocky statures made them incapable of mastering the use of the standard amphistaff used by the warrior caste as a whip. The reptoids instead use the inflexible coufee, which was better suited to their body form, and an inferior breed of the amphistaff. A few Chazrach served the Yuuzhan Vong so well over the generations that they were permitted to join the warrior caste at its most basic levels. History: At some point in the past, the Yuuzhan Vong conquered the Chazrach, and began breeding the creatures to serve as shock troopers during their wars. While not as formidable as the warrior caste, they proved to be single minded and were incapable of being reasoned with. They accompanied their masters onboard the worldships and later participated in the invasion of the galaxy. The first notable engagement where the Chazrach were used was during the Battle of Dantooine where the reptoids were used to attack the New Republic forces on the planet. However, once Luke Skywalker killed the Thrall Herder, the mental control over the Chazrach was removed and the creatures became feral; attacking one another and anything in their sight. Later, Commander Shedao Shai used Chazrach in the Battle of Ithor. Reptoids were also during the invasion of Rychel where they battled against New Republic troopers. Chazrach were bred on Garqi following the planet's fall, and it is likely that other planets were utilized for the same purpose. These creatures remained loyal to their masters throughout the conflict and defended the Yuuzhan Vong Empire at the Second Battle of Coruscant where the Yuuzhan Vong were defeated after the death of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.",

      "description": "Cha´wen´he The Cha'wen'he people of the planet Wen'he'dinae were among the galaxy's most distinctive looking species. Cha'wen'he had two thin legs, decimeter-long bony spikes on their heels, and scaly ovoid bodies. Their most distinctive feature was their three heads, mounted on flexible two-meter long necks. Their three heads were in constant motion, making them difficult to catch them unawares. Their mouths were also ringed with pseudo-fingers, allowing them to use their heads as hands. When threatened, Cha'wen'he could fight back with their heel spikes, or retract their heads into their bodies for protection. With necks fully extended, Cha'wen'he stood up to four meters tall. Though the Cha'wen'he had three heads, they did not have the split consciousness exhibited by the two-headed Troigs and Paaerduags. This was because their single brains were located in their bodies, rather than in their heads. However, their consciousness did have one peculiarity—Cha'wen'he could access knowledge and skills from a collective \"species memory\". Some of this knowledge, such as simple motor skills, would be accessed immediately by Cha'wen'he hatchlings. More complicated skills could take years to surface in a Cha'wen'he's mind, or even remain locked in their subconscious permanently. Cha'wen'he, having evolved as herbivores on a planet teeming with predators, were typically nervous and excitable. Their society was organized in nomadic \"flocks\", whose informal leadership was constantly changing. This made it difficult for offworlders to arrange treaties with them, as an arrangement concluded with one flock might not be honored by their next leader, or by the next flock to live in the area. As a further frustration, Cha'wen'he owned all of their possessions and buildings communally. Though they learned to understand alien concepts such as \"private property\" and \"no trespassing\", they sometimes ignored them. Cha'wen'he had been in contact with the Galactic Republic for millennia, enthusiastically traveling the spacelanes as scouts, explorers, and navigators. While the Cha'wen'he were under the nominal rule of the Galactic Empire, their tendency to ignore certain Imperial dictates led to incidents of brutal oppression. Due to the fluidity of their leadership and their nomadic lifestyle, these were often directed at the wrong Cha'wen'he.",

      "description": "Chev The Chevs were one of the two native sentient species of the planet Vinsoth. These humanoids were slaves of the Chevin, Vinsoth's other indigenous people, for most of their recorded history, a fact which shaped their culture and their interactions with the rest of the galaxy. Biology & Appearance: Though they were sometimes classed as Near-Humans, other sources indicate that they were humanoids who evolved from Vinsoth's indigenous primates. By the time of the Galactic Empire's rise, they had been enslaved by the pachydermoid Chevin for millennia. The outward appearance of the Chevs was generally similar to that of Humans, with pale skin, short blond or white head hair, no facial hair, and heavy brows. Their hair was often dyed in bright colors to identify them as property of a particular Chevin. Their lidless eyes were black to violet in color, and were protected by thin transparent membranes. They were physiologically much like other humanoid species, with their twin hearts being a notable exception. According to sources such as The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life, one Chev heart could take over when the other failed, allowing Chevs to live for up to three hundred standard years. As Chev slaves could outlive their Chevin masters, this meant that Chevin slave-owners often left prize slaves to relatives in their wills. Other sources, however, gave a more modest 75 years as a typical Chev life expectancy. Chevs on Vinsoth: The Chevs originally developed a civilization on Vinsoth thousands of years before the Imperial era, thriving for some time before they were enslaved by the Chevin. Since the Chevin were a nomadic people, the Chevs were forced to live nomadically as well. Their temporary settlements of tents and lean-tos were ruled by a Chevin overseer, with the oldest female Chev acting as the leader among the slaves. Giving what political power the Chevs had to the oldest among them was criticized by some younger Chevs, who believed this simply perpetuated the system of slavery. Generations of subjugation had left most Chev docile and submissive. Despite this, they would gather at night to try and understand the strengths and weaknesses of their masters, in hopes that a future generation might someday have the courage and the opportunity to free their people. The Chevs even had legends which foretold that someday, they would become masters of the galaxy. As nomadic slaves, they wore simple garments, and had few possessions. Despite this, they had a rich culture, strong in folklore and the visual arts. Their cultural rituals were tolerated by their masters, and even encouraged as a way to keep the Chevs content. Some Chevin even found lucrative offworld markets for the art of their Chev slaves. Chevs were also highly skilled technically, though they sometimes hid their technical expertise from their masters. In 44 ABY, journalist Madhi Vaandt went to Vinsoth on an assignment to uncover various slaving practices throughout the galaxy, and won popular support for the Chevs after an interview with a former Chev slave. The event, along with the actions of various anti-slavery organizations, caused a galaxywide outcry against slavery, and in the aftermath, the Chev slaves were freed by their Chevin masters. Chev in the Galaxy: Chev slaves were found off-world as well, whether owned by traveling Chevin or sold to non-Chevin masters. Some free Chevs existed away from Vinsoth, escaping either by stowing away on visiting starships or fleeing their masters offworld. Free Chevs tried to keep a low profile, and avoid politics for the most part. Some became quite wealthy, and used their wealth to take almost paranoid precautions against losing their new found freedom. Off-world Chevs who had escaped slavery often dressed elaborately, or tattooed or dyed their skin, in order to express their previously suppressed individuality and set themselves apart from their enslaved brethren. During the Galactic Civil War, some Chevs became part of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, where they befriended members of other enslaved species such as the Wookiees. Interestingly, some Chevin were disgusted by their people's reliance on slavery. A few of these Chevin left Vinsoth, and joined the Alliance. (It is not recorded if any of them worked alongside free Chevs, however.) Ephant Mon, a Chevin ex-criminal and religious leader, led a movement to emancipate the Chev on Vinsoth. Jedi Master Tresina Lobi, who fought in the Yuuzhan Vong War and the Swarm War, was a Chev.[7] Jedi Knight Sothais Saar was also a Chev.",

      "description": "Chevin Chevin were bipedal pachydermoid sentients native to the planet Vinsoth. They had a poor reputation in much of the galaxy, partly due to their involvement in unsavory activities such as smuggling, and partly because they had enslaved the Chevs, a humanoid species who shared Vinsoth with them. Biology & Appearance: The Chevin evolved from smaller relatives of the giant mammals who were wiped out when an asteroid collided with Vinsoth millions of years before the time of the Galactic Republic. Chevin had long snouts which hung down nearly to their ankles. Combined with their intellect, this made them skilled hunters of animals such as backshin, because they could smell out their prey or feed while keeping their eyes on the horizon. It was also their hunting prowess which allowed them to dominate their homeworld and conquer the Chevs. Chevin had thick legs, massive wide bodies, thin rope-like tails, and arms so long their three-fingered hands often brushed the ground. Despite their ungainly appearance, they could walk or run almost as fast as more nimble-looking humanoids. Chevin boasted a double set of eyelids, one of which was transparent to prevent dust and wind from interfering with their vision. Their thick gray skin and efficient circulatory system kept them cool in warm climates and warm in cold climates, though they preferred semi-tropical conditions. The traditional Chevin costume consisted of long, elaborately patterned robes (though they did not wear clothing until they were contacted by other species) and jewelry. One Chevin even possessed the ability to kill a human with just his forehead. Society & Culture: Beginning as simple hunters and gatherers, the Chevin went on to conquer the Chev settlements and extend their nomadic civilization to dominate their homeworld. Vinsoth was rich in food and plant cover, and was eventually visited by offworlders seeking covert bases and food supplies. The Chevin soon gained galactic-level technology through trade, eventually manufacturing their own sophisticated weapons and vehicles. Though their technology was mostly acquired from offworld sources, they reverse-engineered products like starships in order to produce their own designs. Chevin starships were noted for their spacious cargo bays, roomy cabins, and large crews. Most of their technical advances went towards keeping their slaves in line and ensuring the continued domination of their homeworld. Chevin wore clothes only because other species did. Chevin lived in small, mobile communities, with homes mounted on great wheeled carts. Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affulent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves were usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin kept in touch via comlinks, and often converged on a single location to deal with danger. The only Chevin settlements which stayed in place for more than one standard month were the \"Government Villages\", where Chevin dictators lived with their hand-picked advisors. Even these settlements were movable when necessary. Each of the roughly two dozen Government Villages ruled a Chevin nation. These nations rarely warred against each other, beyond the occasional border skirmish, though economic competition was fierce. Warrior-politicians who won their positions through single combat roved from camp to camp, providing information to Chevin dictators. The Chevin saw themselves as opportunistic realists interested in self-safety. Their culture valued the acquistion of power, wealth, and status by any means necessary. Most Chevin preferred to meet their goals through intrigue and subterfuge, letting others fight for them when necessary. They were calm and even-tempered if treated with respect, but quick to become bullies if angered, or retaliate if slighted or cheated. Common Chevin Names: Some Chevin had first and last names, such as Ephant Mon, Phylus Mon, or Negna Mundro. Others were known only by single names, such as Goorin or Hahgalor. Chevin in the Galaxy: Offworld Chevin were often involved in unsavory, semi-legal, or criminal enterprises such as gun-running, the slave trade, and the black market. This resulted in a poor reputation among other species. Their appearance, which many Humans considered ugly, was another factor contributing to their reputation. Chevin on Vinsoth exported Chev slaves, foodstuffs (such as fruit, nuts, and backshin meat), and imported high technology items. Others were peaceful, hardworking technicians, working for more aggressive Chevin. During the Imperial era, most Chevin supported the Empire. Many prominent Chevin had ties to Imperial officers. The Chevin dictators were able to keep order on their homeworld, so the Empire generally stayed out of Vinsoth's internal affairs, and rarely needed to send troops. A minority of Chevin, however, were disenchanted with Chevin culture and its reliance on slavery. Many of these Chevin joined with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and were hunted by other Chevin as a result. Ephant Mon, a weapons smuggler, latent Force-sensitive, and associate of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, was a Chevin. After Jabba's death, Ephant Mon returned to Vinsoth, where he established a Force-worshipping religious group and spoke out against Chev slavery. Eedund Cus, the trainer of Outer Rim Ponderweight Champion shockboxer Lobar Aybock, was a Chevin, as was Ganga Lor, a gangster on Sel Zonn Station.",

      "name": "Clawdite",
      "plural": "Clawdites",
      "description": "Clawdite Clawdites were a humanoid sentient species native to the planet of Zolan. They were one of the few shape-shifting species in the galaxy, and were sometimes referred to as Changelings. Biology & Appearance: In their natural form, Clawdites had the appearance of reptilian humanoids, and in fact had evolved from reptomammals. They had sunken cheeks with a narrow nose and a small mouth. A thin line ran down their foreheads and creased the center of their noses. They possessed large eyes with slit-like pupils, and their irises could be yellow, gold, or blue. Their skin was considered to be rough, and ranged in color from green to yellow. Overall, their appearance was identical to that of their genetic forebears, the Zolanders. Due to genetic manipulation, Clawdites possessed the extremely rare ability to change their appearance. When using this ability, they could change the color and texture of their skin and eyes, mimicking the appearance of other similarly-shaped beings, such as Humans. Shifting into a Weequay, a species with similar facial features, was considered to be an easy task. Though they could not add physical mass to their bodies, they were able to form hair, and could actually make it quite long. Clawdites were also able to mimic the appearance of clothing or jewelry, provided that the item laid directly on their skin, as it was merely a manipulation of their skin's texture. They could not change the appearance of their actual clothing, and had to rely on holographic technology in order to change such items. Their growth of their abilities mainly relied on a Clawdite's age. Younglings were only able to change color, a talent that began at infancy, and baby Clawdites used different hues and colors to indicate their needs to their parents. Unlike most shape-changing species, the Clawdite's shifting abilities actually caused them great physical discomfort. While the range of their abilities varied in individuals, with both age and practice, they could work through the pain of changing in order to alter their appearance in more and more extreme ways. Even the most talented Clawdite, however, lacked the fine coordination it would take to mimic a specific individual's appearance precisely. Only a very talented Clawdite was able to sleep and retain their altered form. If a Clawdite was suitably distracted or hurt, and certainly if they were killed, they would revert to their true form. It was thought to be impossible for a Clawdite to actually change their body structure or body mass, though it appeared that some individual Clawdites, such as Zam Wesell and Nuri, managed this feat through unknown means. As most sentient beings' bodies were composed mostly of water, xenobiologists speculated that the Clawdites ability to change may have laid in the manipulation of water, and that Wesell may have been able to exert greater control over her body's water than most. It was further presumed by those in the field that Wesell used some sort of medical device or injected substance, or that she managed to figure out how to expel and consume water in various quantities to reduce or increase her mass. Though scientists attempted to test their theories about Wesell, no Clawdites were willing to subject themselves to study, fearing repercussions or prejudice should their abilities be fully revealed. Society & Culture: By nature, Clawdites were quiet and solitary beings, often shunning the company of others unless it benefited them. They viewed the rest of the galaxy pragmatically, and were often harsh realists who were often mistrustful and suspicious of others. Not all Clawdites used their shape-shifting abilities, but those who did were forced to undertake great physical pain and effort in order to do so. They often learned meditation and concentration techniques, over long periods of time, in order to maximize their capabilities. It was also necessary for Clawdites to treat their skin with specialized oils in order to prevent cracking or tearing of their skin, due to the difficulty in physically maintaining their disguises. While in their natural form, they were considered to be indistinguishable from their Zolander brethren, but it was possible to distinguish the two via genetic examination. The Mabari were an ancient order of warriors from Zolan, which survived at least until the last decades of the Galactic Republic. Though a few Clawdites, like Zam Wesell, were allowed entry, it was predominantly composed of Zolanders. The Zolanders wisely presumed that training too many Clawdites in the ways of war could create a powerful group of shape-shifting fighters, capable of overthrowing their rule. Any Clawdites who were accepted were closely monitored, and were they to leave the order, they were forcibly pressured to leave their homeworld as well. Those who joined the order often wore Mabari armorweave, and the group presented clasps to their adherents, which signified their ranks. On their homeworld of Zolan, Clawdites were feared and shunned by the Zolanders, who were a deeply religious people. Among their many strong convictions, the Zolanders believed the Clawdites to be impure and sinful. Because of their prejudice, the Zolanders forced the Clawdites to live in slums all across the planet. These ghettos were secured, so that the Zolanders could prevent the Clawdites from spreading. This subjugation continued for centuries on end, and it wasn't until after 4 ABY that they were able to change their situation. After the rise of their new government, the Clawdites began to hold classes for schoolchildren, in order to teach them greater control and efficiency with their abilities. The few Clawdites who left their world most often took advantage of their natural abilities to join militaristic professions, such as spying, assassination, and bounty hunting. Joining groups such as these were the rare occasions where Clawdites afforded their loyalty to others, and they saw it as a positive contribution to the galaxy. They often sought to protect the liberties of other species, sensing in their pain the disparity their own people suffered. History: Hundreds of generations in the past, the planet of Zolan began to become bombarded with harmful solar radiation. Zolander scientists experimented on a group of volunteers, activating dormant skin-changing genes in the volunteers' genetic codes. To the repulsion of the rest of the Zolanders, these volunteers gained the ability to change their appearance. As they passed their genes down, a new species was formed, and the Zolanders quickly sought to marginalize and restrict this new species. After suffering persecution at the hands of their brethren, the very beings who had made them what they were, the altered Zolanders decided to create a new name for their species, to distinguish themselves from those who oppressed them. They now called themselves Clawdites. Hundreds of years after the divergence of their species, the Clawdites still lived in subjugation on their homeworld. During the Separatist Crisis, the assassin Zam Wesell, an ally of Jango and Boba Fett, was hired to help Fett kill Senator Padmé Amidala. Her assassination attempt went awry, however, and she was tracked down and captured by two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. As she lay wounded in the street on Coruscant, Fett felt that rather than allow her to reveal what she knew or attack the Jedi himself, he had to kill Wesell. He shot her in the neck with a poisoned Kyber dart, killing her. Around this same time, the famous pugil athlete, Rolsat Noviee, was discovered to be a Clawdite, due to a random blood test. Noviee had been posing as a Lannik for nine years, and was the highest-scoring and highest-paid player on the planet. After he was found out, Noviee fled offworld. During the Clone Wars, the Clawdites formed a political government for the first time, and sought the help of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After contacting Count Dooku, they believed they would be able to overthrow the Zolanders. Two different Clawdites were known to have worked for the Separatists. One was the bounty hunter, Cato Parasitti, who helped fellow hunter Cad Bane in his mission to steal a holocron from vaults of the Jedi Temple. Another, Braxus Lyn, worked for the CIS as a spy. The Clawdite's hopes of help from Dooku were shattered when he was killed near the end of the Clone Wars by Skywalker. Conversely, some Clawdites served the Republic during the conflict. Bargu was a Clawdite Padawan in the Jedi Order, and a contemporary of Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy. Bargu competed in the Jedi Temple Apprentice Tournament in an attempt to show a Jedi Master that she should be chosen as their apprentice. She was hurt and disqualified during the eighth and final round. After the fall of the Republic, and the subsequent rise of the Galactic Empire, the Clawdites were trapped on their planet by a forced blockade. Following the death of Emperor Palpatine and the fracturing of his Empire, however, the Clawdites finally rose up and fought against the Zolanders, in what become the Zolan Civil War. Inspired by the actions of the New Republic, the Clawdites triumphed during the war, and managed to gain control over seventy-five percent of their planet. Shortly after emerging victorious from their civil war, the Clawdites contacted the New Republic, and sought to become members of the new galactic government. Almost immediately, however, the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, ignited a devastating war. A group of Clawdites formed Guile Company, which served as an intelligence unit behind Yuuzhan Vong lines. With their members numbering just over one hundred, and entering the most hostile of enemy territories, the Clawdites suffered an extremely high casualty rate. Even still, Guile Company kept receiving new volunteers, and they selected only the best shape-shifters. Because the casualty rate was so high, and the fact that their numbers galaxy-wide were so low, Clawdites who had children were disallowed into their ranks. Despite this, some hid the fact they had children from the recruiters, and managed to join. Guile Company remained intact after the war ended, and soon began work for the Galactic Alliance.

      "name": "Codru-Ji",
      "plural": "Codru-Ji",
      "description": "Codru-Ji The Codru-Ji were a race of four-armed humanoids that inhabited the planet Munto Codru. Born as six legged canines known as wyrwulves, they encased themselves in a cocoon at puberty, emerging weeks later as an adult humanoid. Codru-Ji slept standing up, and communicated on a hypersonic level. As their homeworld had very few significant exports, the Codru-Ji were able to stay isolated from the affairs of the Galactic Empire and the New Republic. This allowed them to concentrate on their own complicated internal politics. Leading Codru-Ji families were often the target of \"coup abductions\", ritualized kidnappings of children by political rivals. These abductions almost always ended with the payment of ransoms and the safe return of the children. Ornate stone castles were scattered across Munto Codru. These castles were produced not by the Codru-Ji, but by an unknown extinct civilization. Many Codru-Ji avoided these castles, considering them to be haunted. However, they were sometimes used as provincial capitals. In 137 ABY, the citizens of Munto Codru were forced to join their tribes under the rule of the Empire controlled by Darth Krayt of the One Sith. A Sith Lord named Darth Kruhl personally visited the planet to coerce the Codru-Ji leaders into accepting Imperial rule and assassinate any opposing figure. Biology & Appearance: The Codru-Ji had a highly differentiated two-stage life cycle separating adults from adolescents. Codru-Ji children were born as meter long canids with the six limbs that were distinctive of all Codru-Ji. These pups, known as Wyrwulfs, were frequently mistaken by outsiders as no more than family pets, an impression aided by their inability to speak in anything more than snarls and growls. The juveniles were sociable, often licking guest as a sign of greeting, however, they could also deliver a strong bite to deter attackers. Wyrwulves were given affectionate nicknames such as \"Hrika\" or \"Lirri\" and did not receive their real names until adulthood. Wyrwulves mature for 8 years before entering a cocoon. They remained in this rubbery blue cocoon for a period of a few weeks before emerging in adult form. Adult Codru-Ji appeared as attractive humanoids, albeit with four arms. They lost the thick pelt of their earlier form, but retained other characteristics such as pointed ears, and they still appeared somewhat “canine-faced”. Codru-Ji hearing extended to a supersonic level undetectable to many species. The mature form averaged 1.6 meters in height. Of their four limbs, Codru-Ji had one primary hand, with which they were most skilled. The remainder were “off hands”, though still utile. An unusual trait of the Codru-Ji was that they slept standing upright. They developed sleeping harnesses to secure adults in this position. Some scientists speculated that the Codru-Ji were descended from a highly advanced, yet extinct, species that left a number of ruins on Munto Codru. Society & Culture: Highly xenophobic, Codru-Ji were reluctant to allow members of other species access to their society. Although not particularly afraid of off-worlders, the Codru-Ji were concerned that outside influences would \"rub off\" on their society. Several aspects of their culture, such as ritual kidnapping of children of political rivals, were considered barbaric by galactic standards, and as such the Codru-Ji thought it best to remain removed from the greater galactic scene.

      "description": "Colicoids Colicoids were a sentient insectoid species from Colla IV. They were carnivorous, and sometimes cannibalistic. Colicoids wishing to protect themselves were capable of forming themselves into a tight ball, an ability they emulated when designing the droideka, which they produced in their image. When the Trade Federation made their first purchase of droidekas, they paid with fifty shiploads of exotic flesh. The Colicoids had a strong dislike for the Jedi, something which intensified after the Invasion of Naboo. Colicoids are the species that was primarily responsible for the creation of the droideka destroyer droids used by the Trade Federation in the subjugation of Naboo. They are a race of barbaric, cannibalistic aliens who rarely deal with outsiders, and often deal with their business partners in an overtly hostile manner. Their droids are unparalleled in design, and their ferocity and savagery has given them a dangerous reputation. They are squat, slender beings who, like their creations, can roll into a wheel shape and move at incredible speeds. Colicoids were known to occasionally stop any travelers going through their system and eat them. After the Battle of Naboo, the Colicoids took control of the spice mining operations on Kessel hoping to establish a strong inflow of credits. They also tried to acquire the rights to a spice processing plant on Nar Shaddaa but they had to deal with the slaver Krayn to obtain them. When the Clone Wars broke out, the Colicoids joined the Separatists, and provided them with many droid designs, including the droid tri-fighter and the Colicoid Annihilator droid. The Colicoids were the founders of the Colicoid Creation Nest amongst other companies. The only known predator of Colicoids was the Hueche, which was so feared that the sight of one would cause any Colicoid to reflexively form itself into a ball and roll away. This fear was such a deeply ingrained instinct that it remained even after Hueches were apparently driven to extinction, and even a holographic projection of a Hueche would have the same effect on a Colicoid. Personality: Savage, brutal, and fanatical, Colicoids are a barbaric race of isolationists. They rarely show mercy, and are often aggressive and confrontational. Physical Description: Colicoids are short, squat aliens with a chitinous exoskeleton and the ability to roll their bodies up into a ball when needed. They have a frightening appearance, because despite all their technological advances, they still maintain a violent and brutish exterior. Language: Colicoids speak Colla. Example Names: No known names. Adventurers: Colicoids, being isolationists, rarely leave their homeplanet of Colla IV. When they do, it is usually because of exile from their own people, or because a rogue Colicoid decides that his homeworld no longer has anything to offer him. Many go on to become gladiatorial combatants in the Outer Rim, while others take their droid construction secrets with them and begin producing their own droids.",

      "name": "Columi",
      "plural": "Columis",
      "description": "Columi The Columi were one of the oldest sentient species in the galaxy. They were easily recognized by their large heads (which made up over one-third of their approximately 1.75 meter height) and their vestigial arms and legs. Biology & Appearance: This highly evolved bipedal species were easily recognizable due to their large cranial cavities. They typically stood 1.75 meters tall with a third being carried on their hairless, noseless heads. Another notable feature was their immense black lidless eyes with worm-like veins on their temples. However, their mental evolution had an impact on their physical bodies with their physiques deteorirated. As a result, their boneless arms and legs became appendages that no longer were able to support their own body weight. This was even the case when in their natural low-gravity environment of their homeworld. Thus, their bodies became simply repositories for their lungs, hearts and other invaluable bodily organs. This evolutionary trend also resulted in their vital organs being drawn up towards their cranial activity. Modern age Columi were highly specialized organisms with their brains containing four cerebrums and over one hundred lobes with each being dedicated to an independent function. Beyond their brains, the other organ that had developed in importance amongst the their kind was their eyes that was the only link between their highly evolved brains and the world around them. These developed more than being simply photoreceptors as they were able to see all the wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. This had resulted in them being able to \"hear\" through their eyes by detecting and analysing the frequency of sound or radio waves. This increased development of their visual senses had led to a loss in other organs with them losing their sense of smell, touch and holding only a vague sense of touch. History: The Columi originally evolved from herbivorous reptiles who roamed the marshes of the low-gravity planet Columus. These early members of the species made use of buoyont bellies which helped them crawl through the marsh on four webbed feet. In time, they eventually evolved to walk on their hind legs which allowed them to pick fruit from the trees. After a few thousand years, they underwent their next evolutionary step where they began laying their eggs in the trees which better protected them from predators. This gradually led to life entirely within the trees themselves where they began to develop hands instead of claws. In addition, they evolved prehensile tails which replaced the heavy caudal appendage which they dragged around when they were quadrupeds. Following a few centuries, they mastered the use of tools that in turn brought a rapid series of evolutionary developments. They lost their tails and gained the capacity to walk in a bipedal stance and marked their rise to true sentience. In time, they began to mine minerals and other raw materials from the bedrocks which they used to construct cities that were constructed high above the trees and mud that were supported by great pylons. Over the next few thousand years, they evolved rapidly in technological advancement and in their own evolution. They quickly developed a technological civilization and, by 2,000,000 BBY and again by 100,000 BBY, interstellar spacecraft. The Columi became one of the first species to develop interstellar travel and were the first to send scouts to explore the far corners of the galaxy. However, their early explorations in search of other civilizations led to disappointing results. Every life-bearing planet they discovered, including Coruscant and Duro, was inhabited by people they considered no better than subsentients and barbarians. To make matters worse, the gravity on other planets was much too high for the Columi’s comfort. The disillusioned Columi abandoned space travel, and retreated to Columus to develop in isolation. It was speculated that the Columi followed the example of the Sharu and checked their expansion to avoid the retribution of the Celestials. Over time, the Columi began to develop their minds and their society to the exclusion of their bodies. While their limbs and torsos shrank and atrophied, their brains expanded. They eventually developed highly sophisticated brains, with four cerebrums and over one hundred lobes. Their eyes became highly acute, able to detect most of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, they lost their senses of smell and taste, and became essentially immobile. Eventually, they became utterly dependent on machines, repulsorlift chairs, and droids for mobility and all other physical tasks. These devices were controlled by radio signals generated by the Columi's brain waves. One such device was the Columi mental hoverpod, a vehicle controlled by mental projection. Eventually, the Columi gained sufficient understanding of non-Columi minds to allow the device to be modified to work with other sentients. Society: This species devotion to mental pursuits had led to a deep disdain for physical activities with them holding the view that there was no dignity in any activity except those relating to thought. As a result, they often look down at races that made use of physical forms of labor. The Columi government was a democracy, where every Columi had an equal share in decision making. This resulted in policy discussions which dragged on for years. However, when the Galactic Empire turned its attentions towards Columus, the Columi reacted with uncharacteristic swiftness and joined the Imperial cause. Though the Columi feared and despised other, more \"primitive\" sentients, they were willing to lend assistance to the Empire in exchange for being left alone. Many Columi thinkers held positions within the Imperial administration. A minority of Columi went renegade, and lent their intellectual assistance to criminal organizations or even the Rebel Alliance. Columi in the Galaxy: By the latter days of the Galactic Republic, Columus was something of a backwater, with Columi civilization having been overtaken in influence by younger species. Though their technology was up to galactic standard, it was too specialized to attract significant trade. The Columi tried to attract trade by marketing their homeworld as a tourist destination, though the health benefits of Columus' low gravity were disputed. The Columi also had cloning facilities on their homeworld—facilities which were their only means of reproduction—but civilian use of these facilities was restricted during the Clone Wars. Boss Tosk, a crime lord operating in the Tapani sector, was perhaps the best known Columi renegade. Despite admitting that they had an ancient civilization, the Imperial sentientologist Obo Rin claimed in his Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy that the Empire was the first galactic civilization to make contact with the Columi. These claims, revealed to merely be Imperial propaganda, were similar to those he made about the Mon Calamari. A droid design team consisting of Columi were hired by Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals Company for the creation of the GH-7 medical analysis unit due to their reputation for being logical and efficient engineers.",

The planet was chosen for settlement by the Karflo Corporation, which tried to forcibly relocate a Cor tribe despite legends warning of peril if this occurred. The following day, a large monster erupted from the ground, destroying Karflo's chosen site. Only the return of the Cor tribe was able to subdue the beast. Biology & Appearance: The Cor were a sentient species of felines. They were small in stature, growing to about one meter in height. They had a long, thin tail, and four limbs that each ended in five sharp claws. Each Cor had a tapered snout and long pointed ears. They were covered in fur except for their tail, which appeared bald. Society & Culture: The Cor were a primitive people. They had traditional tribal lands in which they lived together in villages. Their homeworld, Gargolyn IV, had no native predators, and the Cor themselves were a non-violent people, preferring to use peaceful protest, exemplified when the Karflo Corporation tried to forcibly relocate one group from their village. Although unaware of the existence of the Force, members of the species were in fact Force-sensitive and attuned to the light side of the Force. They had shamans who utilized this affinity. History: The Cor evolved on Gargolyn IV, a planet located in Wild Space, where they achieved sentience and created a primitive society. In the dim past, one particular Cor tribe was frequently attacked by a monster that killed many who tried to stop it. Eventually, a shaman managed to subdue the beast, binding it to the land. A legend developed that so long as the shaman's people lived on that spot, the beast would remain bound and captive. Some time later, the planet was scouted by the Karflo Corporation, who decided to establish a colony on Gargolyn IV. They sought settlers to built a temporary spaceport and provide other aid to the project. Karflo also wanted to build a manufacturing facility on Gargolyn, with a Cor village chosen as the ideal site for the construction. This necessitated relocating the Cor tribe, which refused to budge. Karflo authorized force to move them, despite legends warning against any such relocation. A day after the tribe's eviction, a significant explosion erupted at the factory site, and a gigantic beast emerged. It utterly destroyed any settlement Karflo tried to build there. The settlers were forced to venture into Gargolyn's jungles to track down the displaced Cor tribe and return them to their ancestral lands; only in this manner, was the beast able to be subdued.",

      "description": "Covallon The Covallon were a bestial sentient species rarely seen away from their homeworld. The descendants of swift predatory quadrupeds, the Covallon had a developed capacity for sensing others' emotions, a holdover from hunting in packs. Covallon society developed to an early information technology level by the time of the Galactic Civil War, although most Covallon were comfortable with more advanced technology. The Covallon Dælar vuv Tertarrnek served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a spy, having been given to Imperial Moff Harlov Jarnek as a pet. From this position vuv Tertarrnek fed the Alliance with strategic information on Imperial troop and fleet movements in the Tandon sector. Biology & Appearance: The Covallon were a sentient species. They were quadrupeds, having evolved from a swift plains-based predator species. They preferred to walk on all four limbs, although they were physically capable of walking upright when the need arose. On all fours, they averaged a height of 0.9–1.2 meters at the shoulder; while standing on their hind legs, they averaged between 1.8–2.2 meters. Their lower limbs ended in three-toed feet, while their upper limbs ended in four-fingered hands; the digits on both hands and feet were tipped with a sharp claw. Their hands were dexterous and capable of fine manipulation. The Covallon also had a long tail. The Covallon were largely bald, with a pattern of darker markings across their skin. However, a thick mane of hair grew around their shoulders and upper arms. The Covallon head was bald and had a central, backward-pointing horn. They had two small ears and a blunt muzzle with a jaw filled with sharp teeth, a reflection of their carnivorous nature. A number of thin tendrils grew out of each side of their jaws. Overall, the Covallon had a bestial appearance—at least to Human eyes. Society & Culture: Despite being an ancient species, Covallon society remained at an early information technology level; however, Covallon were also comfortable with more advanced galactic machines and technology. They took a long view of events, preferring to wait out adversity rather than take premature action. They invested a significant amount of time planning things before taking action. The Covallon ancestors hunted in packs. In modern Covallon, this manifested in a strong empathetic ability, enabling them to sense the emotions of others. As a consequence, Covallon worked very well in teams, functioning like a finely-crafted machine. Covallon did not feel the need to wear clothing; however, they generally wore clothing of some sort out of protection or for practical purposes. It was common for clothed and unclothed Covallon to mingle freely. The Covallon could understand Galactic Basic Standard. Covallon naming conventions included the use of \"æ\" (the Aurebesh letter Enth) as well as two-part surnames in which the first particle was de-capitalized. History: The Covallon were an ancient species that evolved from a quadruped predator. They developed a low-level information technology society at which point development largely plateaued. They were rarely seen away from their homeworld, and as a consequence, few beings were familiar with their species. Those Covallon who did venture forth from their homeworld often encountered condescension from more humanoid species, who viewed them more as creatures than intelligent beings. Covallon in the Galaxy: During the Galactic Civil War, the Covallon Dælar vuv Tertarrnek served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a spy. The Alliance arranged for vuv Tertarrnek to be given to Imperial Moff Harlov Jarnek, ruler of Tandon sector, as a pet. Jarnek was unaware of the intelligence of vuv Tertarrnek and, consequently, became very fond of his \"pet.\" Vuv Tertarrnek accompanied Jarnek almost everywhere, including high-security conferences. From this position, vuv Terkarrnek obtained confidential information relating to Imperial troop and fleet movements within and through the sector, as well as top-priority codes. Vuv Tertarrnek then relayed this information to the Alliance in coded bursts from a long-range, tight-beam communication hidden within Moff Jarnek's palace on Spirador. By 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance was preparing a plan to arrest Jarken on Spirador, considering him a threat based on the large number of Star Destroyers under his control.",

Because of their intense dislike of outsiders, they spent most of their lives in the caves beneath the planet's fog-shrouded swamps. Coway were bipedal and covered with a fine red down. They had relatively large eyelids and small eyes which were capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, which they used to survive in the subterranean darkness. A Coway's diet typically consisted of fruits, lichens, raw meats and fungus which would be poisonous to them if not for the strong amino acids of his or her digestive system. Compared to the space-age cultures of the rest of the galaxy, the Coway were a primitive lot. Their main technological achievements were fire and weapons made of flowstone. They had little to no sense of higher learning or technology and were fond of charms. They treated death as an inevitable, everyday occurrence. Coway tribes lived in large villages where order was maintained by brute force. Any outsiders who ventured too close would be attacked. Males were dominant in Coway society and each village was ruled by a triumvirate of chiefs who answered only to the will of Canu, a warrior god. If the chiefs encountered gridlock when they attempted to resolve an issue by themselves, they submitted the problem to Canu. Because the Coway believed that Canu demanded strength from his followers, the greatest warriors of the conflicting parties would face each other in single combat until one quit or died. The winner of the contest would be presumed to be favored by Canu and therefore the chiefs would rule in favor of the party that the winner fought for. If the loser had lost because he quit, he and the party that he championed would abide by Canu's judgment and pay his respects to him by hitting the winner in the face. The winner was expected to return the favor or else face the prospect of angering Canu—and another physical contest. The largest known Coway village contained a population of at least two hundred. It was located in a large subterranean amphitheater near an ancient Thrella city that was adjacent to a subterranean lake. The village itself contained two Thrella structures that the tribe kept in an outward state of repair at the very least. The cave drawings of the Coway and the pictographs of the Mimbanites—another intelligent species native to Mimban and genetic cousins of the Coway— were extremely similar to those found in the Temple of Pomojema. This led many New Republic xenoarchaeologists to theorize that the two species and the temple—as well as the ancient civilization that had built it—were connected in some way. The Coway commonly made their way to the surface through Coway shafts which connected to Thrella wells as well as sinkholes and other openings. During their early days, they could come and go as they pleased. However, when the Galactic Empire discovered that Mimban was rich in dolovite, it established a mining facility on the planet. Rather than be subjugated by the Empire as their genetic cousins would be, the Coway retreated further into the subterranean depths, believing that they could find some refuge from the Empire's energy drills. The Coways' relative peace was short-lived. The Empire's mining operations managed to further disrupt their way of life. The Coway responded by rebelling with occasional acts of unpredictable violence. Sometime after the Imperial presence had been well-established, Coway would only periodically venture into the outskirts of the five mining towns. If they were confronted, they would flee. This behavior led many of the locals and miners to mistakenly believe that the Coway were shy and peaceful.

      "description": "Coynites Coynites were Near-Humans from the planet Coyn. Biology & Appearance: Coynites were large bipeds, and typically quite strong. They had fine gold, white, or black hair over their entire bodies. Their heads were crowned with a shaggy mane, with bony forehead ridges in place of eyebrows. Their faces possessed protruding chins, wide flared noses, and deep set eyes. They possessed clawed hands. Coynites could conceivably live up to 250 standard years, but their warrior culture resulted in an average life span of a mere 53 years. Coynites reached physical maturity in their early twenties. Coynite children were born in var'sairk (birth-group or litter; capitalised when referring to noble families) of two to six children. All children of a litter were of the same sex. Society & Culture: They spoke the language Coyn, but could learn to speak Galactic Basic or any other language. As a society, they were known for being quite militaristic and feudal in outlook. Their society was highly class-based and rigid. Their society was led by a single ruler known as the En'Tra, who made all the major decisions for the planet and its people. Nobles were called Ag'Tra. There were 29 Ag'Tra who answered directly to the En'Tra. Each Ag'Tra has at least 58 Kroyn - elite warriors of exceptional honor and status. Each Ag'Tra sent one Kroyn to serve as the En'Tra's bodyguard for one year. Thus, the En'Tra always had 30 Kroyn as a personal eliteguard (one from each noble's holdings and one from the En'Tra's own family). The vast majority of noble families were so appointed thousands of years ago, although every few centuries, a new family would be added to the nobles bloodlines by the En'Tra's decree. It was possible that a family could have its noble status stripped by decree of the En'Tra, but this has never happened. This may be due to the likelihood that the dishonored family would attempt to unite disgruntled factions and lead a revolution; few En'Tras have felt secure enough in their power to risk a full-scale civil war. To help prevent this kind of war the Coynites followed a law called the En'Tra'Sol (King-Law), a ridged code of conduct for all Coynites to adhere to. En'Tra'Sol was an extraordinarily strict code, forbidding virtually any display of \"weakness\" - cowardice in battle being the primary example of this. While subterfuges and behind-the-scenes skulking were not a permissible part of Coyn life, nobles were permitted to indulge in a little political wrangling, and some of this involved setting up unfavorable circumstances for rival nobles, or even large battles with uneven odds. Even so, if any hard evidence of such behind-the-scenes planning came to light, the noble would be branded af'harl. In an extreme case, the entire noble family could be branded af'harl, in which case a new family from within that territory would be selected to be the new noble bloodline. Those who broke this code were known as af'harl, and lost all standing in Coynite society. Most Coynites would rather die in battle than flee and be branded af'harl. Any Coynite who was labeled as such were to be hunted down and killed or enslaved without repercussion. En'Tra'Sol also dictated that the length of mane was directly related to social status. The more respected and successful a warrior, the longer the mane and the more intricate the braids. The type of braid was also indicative of family and Ag'Tra that the Coynite swore loyalty to. Coynites valued long hair, since in their culture long hair was a sign of great combat ability and honor. Aliens with long hair or shaggy coats (such as Wookiees) were treated with respect. Beings who were bald, or hairless, were shunned as deformed beings. Because of their code of honor and a society which prized strength, Coynites saved displays of affection for their own families in private surroundings. Coynite names and words had an important social and status depending on the way they were written. Names were not just words, but stories. By literally translating the meaning of the phrases, it was often possible to know the history of an item, a person, or a location. The longer the name, the more honored a being was or more noble their family. However, Coynites seldom use their full names except when first establishing who had higher standing, such as upon first meeting. As a concession to off-world customs, Coynites would allow aliens to use shortened versions of names, but only if the alien confered the appropriate level of respect upon the Coynite. To deride an object of great importance or be disrespectful was an unforgivable offense. Many Coynite warriors of noble birth had very long names, which an example might be translated as \"Trel'tak, honorable warrior who defeated a noble of higher standing, of Clan Muls'rak, leaders of the War of Unification\". When syllables of a Coynite name are capitalised, it meant that the object, place or person was worthy of great respect. All things associated with the En'Tra are always capitalised. Likewise, proper names were capitalised. Some phrases or names were never capitilised; this indicated a relationship with af'harl. The Coynites found Jedi to be fascinating. The Coynites never doubted that the Jedi were powerful warriors, with their own code of honor, not unlike themselves. However, Jedi were supposed to find peaceful resolutions, and use violence only as a last resort. This dichotomy baffled the Coynites, but they continued to respect the Jedi nonetheless. History: During ancient times, the Coynites were on the verge of extinction. A Coynite named Toral, considered to be the strongest and most influential member of his clan, began to unite Coynites from across the planet to bring peace and stability to their world. Eventually, he was able to unite all the clans, banished the use of biological weapons, and became the first En'Tra. He created the En'Tra'Sol code, which would govern Coynite society for the rest of its history. Toral's son, Arl'Toral, continued his reign and furthered his quest for planetary peace. During the time of the Galactic Empire, the Ag'Tra were split regarding their loyalties. Of the 29, 9 were sympathetic to the Empire, 5 were sympathetic to the Rebellion, and the remaining 15 were neutral. Zal Tuag Th'Trar was an Ag'Tra who supported the Rebellion, while his rival, Zal Afreg Kt'Aya, supported the Empire. Basic Language: Coynitese",

      "name": "Cragmoloid",
      "plural": "Cragmoloids",
      "description": "Cragmoloid Cragmoloids were a rare, sentient species of intimidating pachydermoids with massive builds. They had big, flat ears, manipulative trunks and a number of tusks that could be used in combat—and that were valued by hunters. They also had other less pachydermoid traits, including hands with five nailed fingers. Although prone to attacking in a rage, particularly when facing subterfuge, Cragmoloids disliked gratuitous violence and were a proud, peaceful people. Cragmoloids loved their families and tended to get depressed if separated from them. Cragmoloids evolved on the rocky planet Ankus. They were enslaved by the Galactic Empire and their planet was strip-mined by TaggeCo. Cragmoloids also suffered frequent attacks by hunters who were after their valuable tusks. Due to this, many Cragmoloids accepted the humiliation of sawing off their own tusks. A small number of Cragmoloids left their world to earn a living among the stars. Some of these were Boulad, an information broker living on Coruscant; and Rooty, a gambler and smuggler operating in Hutt Space. Biology & Appearance: Cragmoloids were sentient pachydermoids that resembled anthropomorphic elephants, or simply elephants walking on their hind legs. Cragmoloids had stiff, thick, leathery skin that protected them from damage, and two elephantine, flap-like ears. Among the folds of their skin, a Cragmoloid had two sharp, small, red, beady eyes, which opened wide when the individual was surprised. When crying, each of the eyes shed half a liter of water as a tear. Another pachydermoid trait was the thick facial trunk, which was a manipulative organ: Cragmoloids used their trunk to frisk individuals. They also raised it in moments of surprise. Some Cragmoloids had two smaller, secondary trunks surrounding the main one. Cragmoloids also had natural tusks under the trunk. These could be used in combat to impale an opponent or during a wrath-driven charge. Some Cragmoloids had two big tusks, while others had four smaller ones. In any case, these tusks could be, and sometimes were, sawed off. Cragmoloids were massive in size, commonly reaching three meters of height, and weighting over two hundred kilograms in adulthood. Not only big, but also very strong, cumbersome and intimidating, they commonly found that hiding their bulk was a difficult task. Other Cragmoloid physical traits were less pachydermoid: The top of the head presented coarse, stringy hair, at least in some cases. While Cragmoloids had three-toed, clawed feet, their massive five-fingered hands were humanoid in shape and had nails. Cragmoloids began their adolescence at eight years of age, reaching biological maturity at fifteen. They typically suffered no ills of age before reaching forty, and were considered to be old only at eighty-seven. A Cragmoloid could easily reach the advanced age of one hundred and twenty years. Society & Culture: The Cragmoloid people were proud and valued a promise as a bond. They considered that losing one's tusks was a severe humiliation. They also preferred to face setbacks with direct answers instead of what they considered to be dishonorable tricks—something that did not stop them from pursuing careers in organized crime. Duplicity and deception commonly exasperated Cragmoloids, who were prone to violent attacks of rage when angered. Notwithstanding their physical prowess, Cragmoloids believed that unjustified violence was barbaric and to be avoided. Their civilization was organized into clans. Cragmoloids were so close to their families that they suffered severe depressions if separated from their homes or their friends. A Cragmoloid always preferred chatting about kinship to talking about any other subject, and they commonly praised their direct relatives. Aliens speaking with a Cragmoloid sometimes resorted to asking about their families to obtain the Cragmoloid's trust—although only after enduring many minutes of speeches. Cragmoloids had one-word names. Common Cragmoloid names included Akoom, Darak, Ormoj, Urun, Vuula, Bachus, Ganesh and Trusk. Cragmoloids were an isolated people, commonly speaking only Cragii, the native language of their homeworld. Cragmoloids traveling to other planets commonly learned to speak, but not to read, Galactic Basic Standard. Punctuation in Cragii was not a widely-known subject on other worlds: A grunt could be construed to mean either acknowledgment, amusement or digestive upset. History: The Cragmoloids evolved on the plains of Ankus, a rocky planet in one of the freestanding subsectors of the Mid Rim. At some point prior to 22 BBY, the Cragmoloids joined the galactic community. Although a number of Cragmoloids were identified as Force-sensitives, none of them became a Jedi Knight. The Cragmoloids also became prey to professional hunters, who killed the pachydermoids to keep the Cragmoloids' valuable tusks. This was not the species' only off-world threat: The Galactic Empire, created in 19 BBY, enslaved all the available Cragmoloids, and the company TaggeCo performed extensive mining on Ankus. These three factors pushed the Cragmoloid species towards extinction. As the Empire had caused some of their worries, a few Cragmoloids joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, hoping to help their kin. Cragmoloid in the Galaxy: Cragmoloids were rarely seen in the galaxy, partly as they needed to adapt common appliances to their massive bulks. Boulad, a Cragmoloid information broker in the Undercity of Coruscant, hollowed out a resiplex to create a dwelling appropriate for his size. Circa 18 BBY, Boulad sold Gregar Typho valuable information about Darth Sidious's presence on Mustafar. At some point prior to 22 BBY, two three-meter tall Cragmoloids, Noba and Ook, were captured on Ankus by the Chevin Dark Side Adept Phylus Mon. Mon jailed the Cragmoloids in his menagerie, the starship Animiasma, along with other uncommonly seen aliens. Although the Cragmoloids were intimidating even behind bars, they were really very depressed over their situation. Most Cragmoloids were unable to escape Ankus to the stars during the Galactic Civil War. Those who could commonly decided to saw off their own tusks to avoid the threat of hunters, but to many this was an unbearable humiliation. The free Cragmoloids worked as scouts or with merchants, but the species was almost exclusively seen in Imperial work camps. Around 10 BBY, the Cragmoloid smuggler and gambler Rooty reached Nar Shaddaa. Ashamed for having turned his massive back to his planet, Rooty hoped to forget his disgrace in a hedonistic search of pleasure and rubbing shoulders with the likes of the smugglers Han Solo, Salla Zend and Lando Calrissian. In 1 BBY, Rooty defeated Calrissian at Sabacc, winning 20,000 bet that the Socorran had placed on his hand. Calrissian then admitted he had bet more credits than he actually had available, and offered an alternative payment to Rooty. Understanding that Calrissian was trying to cheat him, the Cragmoloid was enraged and physically threatened Calrissian. A certain Twi'lek offered to pay Rooty the remainder of the debt and, while Rooty agreed, he still retained a dislike for Calrissian in later times.

      "personality": "",
      "physicalDescription": "The Croke were tiny compared to most other sentient species; an individual could fit into a Human hand, and no member of the species grew larger than a Wookiee's fist. The beings were either arthropods or mollusks, and their appearance was grotesque and unattractive by Human standards. The Croke body resembled that of a snail or slug, with oily skin that ranged from black to gray. A Croke crept about on spindly, hairy, black legs; a single individual might have sported as few as a dozen or as many as several thousand such appendages. As tiny creatures, Croke were vulnerable to being squashed by larger beings, and they exuded a greasy slime when crushed. Croke were able to survive in a vacuum for extended periods. At least one member of the species lived an extremely long lifespan; he died from injury after reaching more than 20,000 standard years of age. Croke had a natural ability to disguise themselves behind illusions. The mechanics of this power were ill understood by members of other species—one point of contention was whether such illusions merely affected the minds of living beings or were also able to fool electronic sensors. In reality, the power was based on manipulation of the Force. With this natural ability, the Croke were masters of disguise, able to hide their true form indefinitely and able to trick even the most keen minds and perceptive targets. Indeed, no one viewing a Croke in illusory form was able to penetrate the disguise unless the Croke became stunned or lost consciousness. Using such natural camouflage, a Croke could take on the shape or appearance of anything up to three meters in height. A Croke did not need to appear identically to all who saw the illusion maker; the Croke might spin separate illusions for different viewers simultaneously. For instance, the Croke Rokur Gepta presented himself as a dwarf to some who encountered him, and as a three-meter giant to others. Such illusions fooled all of their target's senses, making such disguises seem completely real even to touch. Nevertheless, such disguises did not grant the Croke additional strength, speed, or other abilities. Camouflaged Croke had to be physically present somewhere within an illusory form; an individual might appear to be Humanoid and hide in the form's foot, for instance. Only damage sustained in the region where the Croke's physical body was located affected the actual Croke. Despite such disguises' artifice, Croke were able to wield weapons and objects as if their illusory form were real. At least some members of the species also were able to disguise smaller objects, such as Croke young.",
