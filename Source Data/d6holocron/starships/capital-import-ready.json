Internally, its holds could be adapted to various pressures and climates with individual configurations. Even though each ship was sold without any weaponry or defensive shields built in, plenty of after-market systems could be added to the Action IV. During the time of the Galactic Republic, the Action IV transport Azure Queen was captured by Black Sun pirates, while en route to the planet Rutan. The Imperial Navy refitted a number of them as Imperial Patrol Ships.",

      "description": "The Action VI transport, sometimes referred to as the bulk transport and the modified action transport, was a popular freighter built by Corellian Engineering Corporation. Action VI transports typically operated in convoys or in well patrolled areas of space. Since they lacked even the most basic forms of self-defensive measures, such as armor and weaponry, they were often prime targets for pirates and so had to rely on protection from other capital ships and starfighter escorts. The only reason they were used by the Galactic Empire was because they were quite inexpensive relative to Imperial wealth. One of these ships once crashed on Blenjeel, after crossing paths with an Immobilizer 418 cruiser. The Rebel Alliance also employed these cargo vessels, often as personnel carriers, but in much smaller quantities since they were far more expensive than GR-75 medium transports. Most Action VIs were stolen from the Empire. Pirates often modified Action VI ships into \"interceptor frigates\" capable of combating corvettes. The most famous Action VI was Wild Karrde, the personal starship owned by smuggler Talon Karrde.",

      "description": "Corellian Engineering Corporation's Action V transport was a member of the Action series of bulk transports. It was a modest upgrade of the older Action IV transport's design. Action V freighters couldn't carry as much cargo as the newer Action VI transports, but were also less expensive, and could be found throughout the galaxy in the ownership of private individuals and freelance traders. The Action V was the most popular of the series, despite the fact that its Class 4 hyperdrive was slower than the Class 3 used in both its predecessor and successor. Due to its shape, the Action V was sometimes referred to as a \"flying hatbox,\" as Wedge Antilles pointed out to Mara Jade.",

      "description": "The Bayonet-class light cruiser was a small capital ship built by Sienar Fleet Systems and used in the Imperial Navy. Armed with eight heavy turbolasers, six laser cannons, and two tractor beam projectors, they served well as patrol craft and were capable of intercepting small transport craft. Using the shuttle and planetary probe carried onboard, they were also occasionally used for survey missions. Bayonet-class vessels were in use during the early days of the Galactic Empire, and by the time of the Battle of Yavin they were considered outdated. They remained in use for duties that did not require a larger or more capable craft, especially in the Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories.",

It is rumored that the Emperor himself owned one of these ships and used it as a personal transport vessel, however given the inability of this design to defend itself it is unlikely that he used it at any time after the Galactic Civil War began. C-3's are common sights throughout the galaxy, and remain in production to this day even if they do make tempting and easy targets for pirates.",

      "description": "The CC-9600 frigate was a CC-series capital ship, designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation and used during the Galactic Civil War. The CC-9600 design was based on the earlier CC-7700 frigate series, but did not mount the latter's trademark gravity well projectors. As such, it had a decidedly different tactical role, namely that of a warship instead of an Interdictor. More compact and more heavily armed, it served as a line frigate. The CC-9600 had enough cargo and passenger space to transport two full regiments of troops. It also was very fast for its size, both in sublight speeds and in hyperspace, making for a formidable warship in its class. Streamlined for atmospheric operation, it had retractable maneuvering fins that improved stabilization while landing and deploying troops.",

      "description": "The CR-20 troop carrier was a type of transport ship used to deploy small units of clone troopers. The CR-20 troop carrier was armed with two double turbolaser cannons. It was sixty meters long and could carry up to forty clone troopers, twelve 74-Z speeder bikes, and their corresponding supplies. The carrier's crew consisted of two pilots, one communications officer, and three engineers. Originally designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation for use by its security forces, the Republic purchased surplus CR-20s one standard month after the First Battle of Geonosis. Despite this, they were widely unseen in the Republic Navy early in the Clone Wars. It was not until the Battle of JanFathal, where Anakin Skywalker piloted a CIS-owned CR-20 to rescue Republic Intelligence operative Hallena Devis, that the usefulness of the CR-20 Troop Carrier became evident. Generally, they were used in situations where the large Acclamator-class assault ships were impractical or unneeded.",

      "description": "The Consular-class space cruiser, commonly referred to as Republic cruiser, was a Corellian Engineering Corporation starship used by the Galactic Republic to transport Jedi and diplomats to troubled spots across the galaxy. The Consular-class space cruiser was a starship designed and manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation and used by the Galactic Republic to transport Jedi and diplomats to troubled spots across the galaxy. Civilian models of the Consular-class cruiser were used for straight-forward transportation and were indistinct. Craft of the Consular class in diplomatic service were painted red to declare their diplomatic immunity and to also serve as a warning not to attack. Red was the color of ambassadorial relations and neutrality for capital ships of the Republic and had been so for many centuries. During the Clone Wars, these cruisers were painted the same colors as Republic attack cruisers. Any ship hailing from Coruscant would be painted entirely red; others would only have stripes. The Republic cruiser was equipped with a salon pod that served as a secure meeting area for Republic representatives and leaders of groups in conflict. There was also a variety of salon pods that catered to different alien species. In emergency situations, the entire salon pod could eject from the mother craft, and with its own sensors, life support equipment, and engines, protect the diplomatic crew on board. The craft also carried a number of escape pods. The cruiser's total capacity was 9 crew and 16 passengers. For increased security on diplomatic missions, the organic crew was kept to a minimum, with many ship functions attended to by droids. Although the diplomatic versions were unarmed, various cruisers were modified to have double turbolaser cannons and two concussion missile launchers installed and to serve in the Judicial Forces and regional security forces, at least some of which were then re-designated as either Republic light assault cruisers or Republic frigates. Others were modified to serve as troop carriers and command ships. Consular cruisers entered service late in the time period of the Republic. An early version of the ship was built after the Ruusan Reformation and was put into service by 990 BBY. They were created due to budget cuts that required the building of new utilitarian and non-ostentatious starships; it was that quality of them that attracted the Jedi to their use. During the prelude to the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY , it was a Consular-class cruiser, Radiant VII, that transported Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to the Trade Federation battleship Saak'ak orbiting Naboo. The ship was assigned a skeleton crew of one pilot and a captain. Both died when the Trade Federation destroyed the vessel. Militarized Consular-classes known as Republic light assault cruisers served the Republic Navy in the Stark Hyperspace War and the Yinchorri Uprising. Those vessels had cannons and extra armor added to their design. During the Clone Wars, some Consular-class ships went through the Charger c70 retrofit, having weapon batteries added and serving as small frigates in the Republic wartime Navy. They possessed a combination of firepower and speed that made them valuable components of the Navy. Civilians such as Noggox the Hutt also used Consulars. One of his freighters was captured by the pirate Dool Pundar. The militarized Consular-class frigates had a paint job similar to the Venator-class Star Destroyers. The tradition of painting strictly diplomatic vessels red continued even into the days of the Galactic Empire. Princess Leia Organa's vessel, the Tantive IV, was striped in red to indicate diplomatic immunity. A handful of armed cruisers were still in operation throughout the galaxy during the Galactic Civil War. The smuggler Rif Taranu aided the Rebel Alliance by using his modified cruiser Dead Reckoning to transport goods for them. Several were seen at the Jubilee Wheel early in the Yuuzhan Vong War, and participated in the Battle of Yag'Dhul.",

      "description": "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship was one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and was the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it was fast and carried heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship had minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships were designed to be only two things: fast and deadly. Engines consumed nearly half of the gunship's interior space. What little room was left was used for deflector shield generators and weapons. Armed with eight double turbolaser cannons, four concussion missile tubes, and six quad laser cannons, the Corellian gunship was effective against both larger capital ships as well as starfighters, though it was primarily used against the latter. These ships were 120 meters long. Each one carried a crew of 45, along with 46 gunners. They were equipped with Class 2 hyperdrives. The DP20 was originally designed for the fleet of the Galactic Republic. These vessels saw extensive use among the Corellian and Rebel Alliance/New Republic fleets, although some were also seen in the hands of independent operators, such as pirate factions and other fringe groups. Local Imperial forces also utilized the class. The Rebel Alliance, in need of a small, fast attack vessel, decided to purchase a few of these starships after witnessing a group of pirates use them to successfully hijack an Imperial shipment guarded by several Imperial fighters and bombers. At least one of these vessels was wrecked in the Korteen asteroid belt by Quarg's father and his space wreckers.",

      "description": "The CSS-1 Corellian Star Shuttle, also known as the Republic shuttle, was a starship designed to carry a large number of ambassadors on missions throughout the galaxy. The CSS-1 Corellian Star Shuttle was more spacious and could carry more people compared to the Consular-class cruiser. It also featured a large meeting room. Because they were diplomatic vessels, Star Shuttles lacked weapons but boasted a powerful deflector shield. The class was manufactured by the famous Corellian Engineering Corporation, which manufactured most of the vessels in use by the Galactic Republic. They were less versatile than most CEC designs, in part due to their extensive armor plating. The transport had a crew of one captain, two co-pilots, two communications officers, and three engineers. It could also carry about 200 passengers and 900 metric tons. Star Shuttles served the Republic in its last decades as diplomatic vessels, but some ships were modified for military service and were equipped with at least two turbolasers. They served in the Judicial Forces and fought in the Stark Hyperspace War, the Yinchorri Uprising, and the Clone Wars. The Corellian Star Shuttle Perpetuus transported Chancellor Palpatine to Theed following the Battle of Naboo. After the transformation of the Republic into an Empire, many Star Shuttles ended up in private hands. At least one Star Shuttle was used to make up a secret retreat in 137 ABY.",

      "description": "The Corona-class armed frigate was a saucer-shaped craft manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering before the Clone Wars. It was based on an ancient Surronian cruiser design. It was produced by Haor Chall Engineering before the Clone Wars. The ship proved to be unfit as a droid ship for the CIS. Haor Chall canceled the production and sold the remaining ships to investors and other people who were interested in buying one. During the Clone Wars they were considered antiquities, and collectors paid many credits for these vessels. The vessel rotated while in flight, which was its main source of propulsion. As such, they also gave off a distinct humming sound while in flight. They had enough room for 6 Flarestar-class Weequay ships, which could be launched from the center of its ventral superstructure. The craft was capable of landing on planetary surfaces and had eight landing legs. The eighth doubled as boarding ramps. The pirate band of Hondo Ohnaka used such a ship to carry out their raids. Ohnaka stole the ship from a starship collector on Farana along with several Flarestar-class Weequay ships. They landed on Vanqor during Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker's hunt for Count Dooku, and scavenged the Count's Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop. Ohnaka offered the Count passage to Florrum, a planet six parsecs away. Dooku accepted the offer to travel with them in the ship to their base on Florrum.",

      "description": "The IR-3F-class light frigate, commonly referred to as the IR-3F patrol craft or IR-3F, was a light frigate designed by Sienar Fleet Systems for use as a system patrol and customs ship. The IR-3F was 110 meters long. It had a high power output and fast sublight engines for a ship of its size, and could achieve atmospheric flight at 1,000 kilometers per hour; however, it was not equipped with a hyperdrive. It was equipped with shields, and armed with four turbolaser cannon turrets, though some models were equipped with four fire-linked heavy laser cannons instead. The ship had a crew of 11 (including 8 gunners), though it could be staffed by a single individual in some circumstances. It carried ten troops, three months' worth of consumables, and had space for 180 metric tons of cargo. The small crew was often inadequately rotated, resulting in a tendency for them to wear down quickly. Patrol ship tactics generally led to these ships operating within an hour's distance of their base of operations, and maintaining continuous comlink contact with it. When engaging a target, they employed their high speed and brute force to disable or destroy it before it could escape into hyperspace. The IR-3F was the predecessor of the IPV-1 System Patrol Craft. However, the craft still saw some use with single-system governments, including Core Worlds within the Ringali Shell. It also saw limited use in the Imperial services, particularly in systems with large support vessel populations or ongoing blockades. IR-3Fs formed the Imperial Navy's Digit Squadron at Bakura. Five of them fought against the Ssi-ruuk at the Battle of Bakura; three of those ships survived, becoming the property of the Bakuran government when that world became independent. They continued serving under the Bakuran government for decades afterward.",
