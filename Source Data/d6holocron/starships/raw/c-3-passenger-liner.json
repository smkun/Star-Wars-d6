It is rumored that the Emperor himself owned one of these ships and used it as a personal transport vessel, however given the inability of this design to defend itself it is unlikely that he used it at any time after the Galactic Civil War began. C-3's are common sights throughout the galaxy, and remain in production to this day even if they do make tempting and easy targets for pirates.",
