The central section of the ship had two decks, with the control areas on the upper deck and the lower deck containing cargo and maintenance bays. A number of pirates acquired PB-950 patrol boats for illegal purposes, using their stock ion cannons to disable target vessels.\n\nThough it was phased out of production in favor of the more powerful Light Corvette, tens of thousands of PB-950s were known to be in use throughout the Galactic Empire.\n\nThe Corellians employed these craft during the original Corellian Crisis.",
