The Theta Class Patrol Shuttle is a large fighter armed with three laser cannon mounted on pivoting mounts on the forward point of their wings, and with a Concussion Missile Launcher mounted underneath the fighters hull. The combination of these two weapons, the vessels tough hull and long range made these deadly strike fighters, however their expense compared to the far more economical TIE series of fighters limited their introduction to high security areas where they were used for patrolling and defense.\n\n'''Source''': [http://www.RPGGamer.org www.RPGGamer.org]",
