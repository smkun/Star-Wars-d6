Their armament was adequate for skirmishes between low-tech fleets, but the Daupherm Planet States eventually realized they were falling behind the technology curve, and the ''Discril''-class was slowly phased out of service around the time of the Battle of Yavin.\n\nMany of these ships were stored away in reserve and others were scrapped, but some made their way into the Galaxy at large. A few were legally sold on the used arms market, and at least one was stolen by its captain. They served especially well as pirate vessels.",
