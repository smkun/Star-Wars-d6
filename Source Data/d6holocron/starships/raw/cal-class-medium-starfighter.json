Developed by the Mon Calamari at about the same time as the \"Eloquent\" class, this fighter is a terror among the Imperial remnants. Like other Mon Cal ships, these fighters are unique in construction, and that means that the RMC-1 astromech assigned to each Cal starfighter must be present to assist in repairs. Naturally, the repairs are done by Mon Cal to ease the stress on other techs. The ship is fast, strong, and piloted by Mon Cal themselves, so they are even more effective. Two unique features of this fighter is the rear laser and concussion missile turret. The gunner sits in the turret and rotates & swivels with the armament. This has proven to be a very good idea, as the amount of losses suffered by the Cal fighters has been extremely low, and the Council wishes it to stay that way.",
