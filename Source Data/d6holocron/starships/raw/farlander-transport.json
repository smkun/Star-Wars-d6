He let's all his pilots who smuggle things for him use these ships, of course taking some out of their paycheck.  Eventually he will let you buy one.  Doono uses them for their speed, a means to avoid any Imperial entanglements, seeing as how all his cargo is illegal.  If any smuggling runs are made with him, he forces you to use these ships, or something faster if you got it.\n\n'''Source''' www.RPGGamer.org",
