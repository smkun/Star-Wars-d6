Originally designed as an inter-system ferry, Rebel Kleeque-class vessels were modified into regimental troopships.\n\nThough they were never intended to enter space combat, they were often used to run blockades and make landings in contested territory. Echo Base on Hoth had six Kleeque-class transports on standby for evacuation in addition to their fleet of thirty GR-75 medium transports. All six Kleeque-class transports were destroyed trying to run the Imperial blockade of the planet.",
