Though newer scouts existed, this model remained popular during the Galactic Civil War thanks to its good speed and maneuverability for its class. It was one of the few ships that could slip past a blockade without being noticed, and so was sometimes used to get important people off blockaded planets.\n\nMol Hedron was known to use a modified version of this ship for spying on New Republic activities. He installed a tight-beam high powered transmitter to send nearly undetectable messages.",
