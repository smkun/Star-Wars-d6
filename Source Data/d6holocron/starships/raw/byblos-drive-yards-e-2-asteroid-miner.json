Pirates were known to use E-2s.\n\nE-2 vehicles had rugged claws which could cling on to the hard rocky surface of an asteroid and plasma drills for cutting through them. E-2s were also equipped with thruster jets for transporting asteroids to mining locations. A central suction tube would draw the material up into the vehicle's filter system where the valuable ores were stored in cargo bays.",
