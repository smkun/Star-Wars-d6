The result was the Archer Corvette. The corvette can be used for several assignments, including escort duty, interception, light combat or priority transports. The ship features excellent sublight engines and is still small enough to enter planetary atmospheres as well as to land on their surfaces. The ship's weapons complement is a good match for most pirate ships and may even threaten other small capital ships. The corvette's small hangar houses one squadron of TIE fighters as well as one long-range shuttle. There is also a large cargo bay, able to carry up to 2,500 metric tons. This cargo space can be converted to increase the troop capacity, to enlarge the starfighter complement or for other purposes depending on the mission profile. Archer-class corvettes are usually assigned to the more remote areas of Imperial Space where the Empire cannot afford to send larger ships and the corvette serves the Empire well in its role",
