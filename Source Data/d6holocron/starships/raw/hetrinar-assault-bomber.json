They have not had to use it much, but with the military alliance between them and the New Republic, barely used technology is quickly becoming front line equipment. The Hetrinar is a typical example of Hapan craftsmanship - durable and powerful with a definite flair in its design. It isn't quite as capable as the New Republic K-wing, but it does the job well, with three heavy rocket launchers and a double laser turret for point defense.Though it remains unseen whether or not the Hapans will remain with the New Republic now that their fleet has been largely destroyed, elements of the Hetrinar will undoubtedly make their way into New Republic technology.",
