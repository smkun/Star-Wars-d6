The bulky Dx-9 carries a powerful array of weaponry that includes two quad laser cannons, a quad Ion cannon and a pair of proton torpedo launchers. The torpedo launchers each have a magazine of 8 and are mounted on the front of the engine housing. The pilot and co-pilot control the torpedo launchers, whilst the three gunners control the other weaponry.\nThe Dx-9 is propelled by two Telgorn L3 Ion engines, which are quite fast considering the age of their design, that are mounted on upper left and upper right sides of the starship.\nDx-9s have a number of airlocks so that the transport can dock with virtually anything and still allow access for its passengers. Dx-9s usually have forward, rear dorsal and ventral airlocks for the greatest amount of flexibility. Each airlock is equipped with magnetic and mechanical clamps providing the Dx-9 with a versatile docking capability.Due to their durability, offensive/defensive capabilities and hyperdrive a number of the DX-9s have had their passenger area converted into additional cargo space and are used to ferry priority cargo for the Empire. Their success has led to the Alliance 'acquiring' a number of these very useful starships.\n\n'''Source''': Unofficial",
