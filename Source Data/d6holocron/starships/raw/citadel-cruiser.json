It was first manufactured some time before the Battle of Naboo.\n\nhe Citadel-class shared some design features with the BTL Y-wing starfighter, which was considered a sister ship. It was extremely sturdy, and could take severe punishment and still get to its destination. It was designed for a group of people who wanted a starship, but could not afford a capital ship.\n\nDue to their sturdy construction, these ships stayed in use for a long time and were transferred to many different owners. They were used as luxury yachts and as warships for the Rebels, freebooters, the Corporate Sector Authority, and pirates. This led to many of them having a jumble of various features; such as smuggling compartments, military add-ons, and luxury furnishings. They had two docking clamps to carry starfighters for additional protection and firepower.\n\nOne notable Citadel-class cruiser was the Long Scale, owned by the Trandoshan mercenary Ssorku.",
