The cockpit is small and cramped, even for a diminutive pilot. The canopy is bubble-shaped, providing excellent visibility in all directions. Three KIC vectored ion engines dominate the rear half of the fuselage.The CL-12 was designed and manufactured as a light scout craft, and marketed towards local security forces, with which it was quite popular. Unsurprisingly, it is also popular amongst pirates and mercenaries. Although blessed with high speed and maneuverability, it is by no means a rugged craft. Many pilots complain that the CL-12 sees more maintenance than flight time, but the additional care is required to keep the power system and shield generators running smoothly. In addition to its speed, the CL-12 is gifted with a top-notch Xelandran sensor system.",
