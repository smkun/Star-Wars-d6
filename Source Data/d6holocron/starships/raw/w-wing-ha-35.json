It was stolen from the Echo Base computer during the capture of Hoth, and updated to Imperial technology. It now serves as a heavy bomber, and serves very well. The reborn Emperor used these in his failed campaign to destroy the Rebellion.\n\nThe W-wing is a heavy assault platform of which the Empire launches its most important attacks. It has a triple laser cannon setup, and an ion cannon for flexibility. However, its most important feature is the warhead launcher, which can fire any missile, torpedo, rocket or bomb in the Empire's arsenal. This makes the W-wing ideal for missions where one requires a starfighter interdiction, and the next a cruiser to be destroyed.\n\nThe W-wing cannot replace the venerated Star Hammer, but is much less expensive, and can (usually) still give the punch needed.Tactical Deployment: The W-wing is deployed as a standard TIE flight or squadron, but can be deployed in pairs or singly, if wished.",
