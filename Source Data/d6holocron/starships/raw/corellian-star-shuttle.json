It also featured a large meeting room. Because they were diplomatic vessels, Star Shuttles lacked weapons but boasted a powerful deflector shield.\n\nThe class was manufactured by the famous Corellian Engineering Corporation, which manufactured most of the vessels in use by the Galactic Republic. They were less versatile than most CEC designs, in part due to their extensive armor plating.\n\nThe transport had a crew of one captain, two co-pilots, two communications officers, and three engineers. It could also carry about 200 passengers and 900 metric tons. \n\nStar Shuttles served the Republic in its last decades as diplomatic vessels, but some ships were modified for military service and were equipped with at least two turbolasers. They served in the Judicial Forces and fought in the Stark Hyperspace War, the Yinchorri Uprising, and the Clone Wars. The Corellian Star Shuttle Perpetuus transported Chancellor Palpatine to Theed following the Battle of Naboo.\n\nAfter the transformation of the Republic into an Empire, many Star Shuttles ended up in private hands. At least one Star Shuttle was used to make up a secret retreat in 137 ABY.",
