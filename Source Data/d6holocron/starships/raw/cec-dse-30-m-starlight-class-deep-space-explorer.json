Originally built to explore new space lanes and develop trade routes during the glory days of the Old Republic. Back then, CEC’s market strategy fed upon new space lanes and dependable ships. The production of the DSE-30 design dwindled as expansion of the Republic. Even if the most horrible of circumstances occur with deep space exploration, the ship’s two escape pods and a hypertransceiver dramatically increase the survivability ratios for the crew.\n\nRecently CEC officials have decided to pull this old design out of mothballs and start production again. The CEC DES-30/M possesses upgraded weapons and engine systems. While its original exploration is no longer of great concern, growing instability in the galaxy has led to the market for a long range transport with more space for cargo and personnel than the YT series possesses. The extra space allotted to sensor and communications equipment (leftover from the original exploration specs) also makes this ship popular as a covert communications and command ship for both Rebel and Imperial forces.\n\nAnd, like the YT series, this ship can be upgraded and modified quite extensively to suit the needs of the owner.",
