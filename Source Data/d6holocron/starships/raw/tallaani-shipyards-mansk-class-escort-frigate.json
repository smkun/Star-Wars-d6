The Mansk-class Escort Frigate is a quite reliable ship and is often used by the Rebel Alliance during the Era of the Empire. The ship is well-armed and hits though, the shields and the hull-plating are excellent. The Light Escort Frigate is often used as a patrol craft as it has strong sublight engines and has enough firepower to deal with most small craft. The ship is also used as an exploration vessel because of it's good sensor package. This ship can be given many different assignments and it can easily be modified.",
