It was designed for high-speed descent from orbit to the surface, and its hull was coated with VACX, which burned off during re-entry and had to be replaced before the next deployment.\n\nThe MT/191 was flown by single pilot, and armed with shields and a single retractable light laser cannon above the cockpit. The cannon had a maximum range of 1.7 kilometers in atmospheric conditions, and was only useful as a mild deterrent. It was always retracted during drops.\n\nTwo flights of MT/191s were to the Special Unit squadron of the Scimitar Assault Wing aboard the Star Destroyer Retribution, allowing aerial assaults to be followed up immediately by surface attacks. When not in combat use, these were used as shuttles or as cargo barges.\n\n1,860 MT/191 drop-ships were carried by the Death Star I. The ships were also carried on torpedo spheres.",
