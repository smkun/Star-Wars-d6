Originally this artwork was used on the 54 meter Imperial cargo shuttle also known as the Curich-class shuttle. This artwork originally appeared in the Star Wars Campaign Pack published in 1988 and reprinted in 1994 in Classic Campaigns. The older artwork's stats were re-sized to 80 meters in length and new exterior artwork was produced to differentiate it from the older smaller ship for the 1990 publication.",
