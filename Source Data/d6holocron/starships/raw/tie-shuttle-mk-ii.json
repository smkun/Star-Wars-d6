The TIE Shuttle Mark II features a slow hyperdrive unit which makes system jumps or other hyperspace travel of short duration possible while its predecessor was only designed to travel between the ships of a particular fleet as it was not equipped with a hyperdrive. The installation of the class-4 hyperdrive unit required the reduction of the original shuttle's passenger capacity from two passenger to one.",
