Using the shuttle and planetary probe carried onboard, they were also occasionally used for survey missions. \n\nBayonet-class vessels were in use during the early days of the Galactic Empire, and by the time of the Battle of Yavin they were considered outdated. They remained in use for duties that did not require a larger or more capable craft, especially in the Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories.",
