Additionally, it had a class 1.5 hyperdrive, which was relatively fast for a starfighter, but lacked a backup.\n\nThe designers of the C-wing saw it as being a large, tough starfighter, and so didn't feel that it had to be particularly fast or maneuverable, though it was able to achieve a standard attack speed. Because of this, the hull and shields of the C-wing were relatively strong for a starfighter. It also housed four fire-linked heavy blaster cannons, as well as a single proton torpedo launcher.\n\nWithout the weapon systems, the ship was priced at 116,000 credits, though with weaponry the price jumped to 130,500 credits (plus the cost of each proton torpedo to be loaded into the launcher).\n\nIt is unknown if any of these ships were actually produced.\n\n\n'''Source''':  [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Starships_of_the_Galaxy_%282001%29 Starships of the Galaxy]",
