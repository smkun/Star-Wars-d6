Most of these ships were sold to planetary governments to help fund to purchase of Imperial Class Star Destroyers, although were \"liberated\" after a large number of Nebulon-B Frigates defected from Imperial service. These ships are mostly seen protecting convoys of ships, although are used as front line ships in the Outer Rim and Unknown Territories.",
