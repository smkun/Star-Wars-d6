In the early days of the Rebellion was it the major fighter type in use and subsequently participated in numerous battles. The Y-wing´s main benefits are its versatility and durability in combat. However, it became increasingly more vulnerable against the faster and more maneuverable TIE fighter models that were introduced as the years went by. With the introduction of newer rebel starfighters such as the X-wing, was the Ywing transferred from pure fighter missions into fighter-bomber missions, were it attacked enemy starships or ground installations in-stead of starfighters. Many were also transferred from regular fleet use to local sector commands were they became the main striking weapon against the Empire. With the introduction of the New Republic, it served in local defense and sector patrols as well as training new fighter pilots. Several independent systems also bought large numbers of this fighter for their starfighter forces and the Y-wing has even served with the Imperial Star Fleet, although primary in the aggressor role for training TIE pilots and ship gunners against rebel tactics. Its versatility coupled with the many starfighter factories geared towards building Y-wings plus the ease of production and availability of parts, made the Y-wing one of the longest produced starfighters ever. In fact, the last Y-wing rolled off the production line roughly two year after the defeat of Grand Admiral Thrawn.\n\n\n=='''The Y-wing mark II''' (Unofficial)==\n[[File:ywingstarfighter2.jpg|400px|thumb|right]]\n\nThe original Y-wing was a potent craft able to endure and deliver tremendous punishment, but it was not as fast, maneuverable or heavily armed as modern starfighters. To rectify those problems some of the best technicians in the Alliance formed a special task group specifically dedicated to upgrading the Y-wing. The main goal to achieve was to increase survivability, while maintaining the basic versatility of the original Y-wing design. By installing more powerful sub-light engines (made possible by the addition of an extra ion coil to the R200 Ion Jet Engine), did the space speed increase by over 10 percent. Reconfigured steering plates and disk vectrals enhanced maneuverability, while the hull gained more blast resistant outer layers. The original sensor array was replaced by the more powerful one used by the X-wing, which simplified production and increased the availability of spare parts. The recon variant received an improved version of the A4 sensors, while the wild weasel variant got the most sophisticated sensor equipment of them all. To improve its offensive capability, the original Taim & Bak laser cannons was replaced by a new, improved version, which substantially increased the damage rating. The ion cannon was not replaced, since the basic design was considered to be good enough. The proton torpedo launchers were heavily modified. The magazine capacity was increased and steps taken to reduce the time necessary to reload. Externally the Y-wing II looks slightly different from the original Y-wing. The sub-light engines are a bit longer, although the support pylons have been shortened, so the length of the Y-wing is still 16 meters. In addition, the housing for the proton torpedoes has been elongated in order to take the increased magazine. The Y-wing II replaced the original Y-wing on the production lines between the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor. During the early days of the New Republic some of the older Y-wing´s was upgraded to the new standard, but the majority were sold, scrapped or relegated to planetary defense roles. Instead, the Y-wing mark II took over majority of the roles performed by the original Y-wing., while the rest was performed by newer starfighter designs.\n\n\n\n==BTL-P1 Y-wing \"Prototype\"==\n'''[[File:Btl-p1-2.jpg|thumb|500px|right]]'''\n\n'''BTL-P1 Y-Wing Prototype'''<br />\n'''Craft:''' Koensayr BTL-P1 Y-wing<br />'''Type''': Prototype attack starfighter<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, gunners 1, skeleton: 1/+5<br />'''Crew Skill''':'''\n*Astrogation 4D\n*starfighter piloting 4D+2\n*starship gunnery 4D+2\n*starship shields 3D\n'''Cargo Capacity''': 90 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 week<br />'''Cost''': 175,000 credits (very limited number)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': Limited to 2 jumps<br />'''Maneuverability''': 3D<br />'''Space''': 8<br />'''Atmosphere''': 365; 1,050 kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+1<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 40/1D\n*Scan: 60/2D\n*Search: 80/3D\n*Focus: 3/4D\n'''Weapons''':　\n*2 Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 100-300/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D\n*2 Blaster Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-5/10/17<br />Atmosphere Range: 100-500/1/1.7<br />Damage: 3D\n*2 Light Ion Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Turret*<br />Crew: 1 (co-pilot)<br />Skill: Starship gunnery<br />Fire Control: 4D<br />Space Range: 1-3/7/36<br />Atmosphere Range: 100-300/700/3.6 km<br />Damage: 4D\n\n\n*Gun may be fixed to forward to be fired by pilot at only 1D fire control.\n\n'''Capsule'''\n\nThe Y-Wing was the Rebel Alliance's first starfighter with a hyperdrive and still plays an important role in the Alliance forces. But before the well-known Y-wing starfighters were produced in series, a prototype fighter was developed, the BTL-P1. But unlike its predecessor, the BTL-S3 - the Rebels' standard variant - the prototype was a three-man vessel. The crew consists of the pilot, the gunner for the Ion Cannon Turret, and one sensor operator. One of the prototypes special features, for, was the sensor pod below the cockpit (see picture). This sensor pod made it also a perfect craft for reconnaissance duty. The prototype thus is a compromise between an assault fighter and reconnaissance vessel. The prototype Y-Wing was also slightly more maneuverable and had faster sublight engines than the production models. But the test pilots encounters technical problems during atmospheric flights at maximum speed. The following researches revealed that the engine construction was not stable enough for such extreme maneuvers. The wound point was the the cross wing at the rear of the central spar where the engines are attached. In order to save the pilots' lives, maneuverability and sublight speed were slightly scaled down for the both production models (BTL-S3 and BTL-A4 Longprobe). Also the sensor pod was removed for the following Y-Wing models. A much weaker sensor unit was installed instead, hence the out of focused sensors about which many pilots are complaining about when flying an BTL-S3. Another difference to the later models is that the prototype was not equipped with an astromech droid, instead had a small nav computer which was able to store two jumps. This was changed for the production models due to the Rebels' tactics - to drop out of hyperspace, quickly attack their targets, and immediately flee into hyperspace again - operations that were managed more successfully with an astromech droid storing ten jumps. This early model did, however, not yet have a complement of proton torpedoes, instead, a pair of forward-mounted blaster cannons was installed. But with the development of the production models (BTL-S3 and BTL-A4) and the Rebels' need for more heavy weaponry to strike against capital-scale vessels, replaced by the BTL-S3, carrying proton torpedoes, for heavy assault missions and the BTL-A4, a one-man reconnaissance fighter. The two mission profiles now were separated, and there was no need for the BTL-P1 any longer.\n\n==BTL-F1 Y-wing \"Fighter\"==\n'''F1 Y-wing Fighter'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-F1 Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br /> '''Type''': Space Superiority Starfighter<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 1, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Starfighter Piloting 4D+2, Starship Gunnery 4D+1, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 80 kg<br />'''Consumables''': One week<br />'''Cost''': 134,000 (new), 60,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 8<br />'''Atmosphere''': 365; 1050kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 20 / 0D\n*Scan: 35 / 1D\n*Search: 40 / 2D\n*Focus: 2 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunner<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 8<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D<br />\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThis was Koensayr's first attempt to make a hyperspace capable starfighter. It was only a partial success. The main fault was in making a starfighter with mediocre performance. Nevertheless was this the only modern hyperspace-capable fighter available to the Alliance in the beginning. The BTL-F1 has a slightly smaller cockpit than other Y-Wing variants and has a power booster generator placed right behind the pilot instead of a gunner. When the higher performing X-wing came into service, many BTL-F1's where converted into BTL-T2 Trainers. However, the increased demand for starfighters after the Battle of Yavin meant that plenty of the BTL-F1 variant continued in active duty as fighters, although most of them served in low-threat areas.\n\n==BTL-T2 Y-wing \"Trainer\"==\n'''T2 Y-wing Trainer'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-T2 Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Trainer<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 2D+2, Starfighter Piloting 3D, Starship Gunnery 3D, Starship Shields 2D+2<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': One week<br />'''Cost''': 125,000 (new), 60,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 7<br />'''Atmosphere''': 350; 1000kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 20 / 0D\n*Scan: 35 / 1D\n*Search: 40 / 2D\n*Focus: 2 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Scale: Starfighter<br />Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 8<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D<br />\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe BTL-T2 variant of the Ywing series is a dedicated trainer version. It is basically a standard BTL-F1 with identical controls for the pilot-in-training in front and his instructor in the rear. The second crew station was made possible by increasing the size of the cabin and removing the power booster generator. The penalty for this was slightly reduced performance. Some were newly built to this standard but the majority was converted from F1's, after they were replaced by the X-wing as the standard Alliance fighter. Most of the conversions took place after the Battle of Yavin to cope with the increased number of volunteer pilot trainee's.\n\n==BTL-T2mod Y-wing \"Intel Courier\"==\n'''T2mod Y-wing Intel Courier'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-T2mod Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Special Intel Courier<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 1, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Starfighter Piloting 5D, Starship Gunnery 4D+2, Starship Shields 3D+2<br />'''Passengers''': 1<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 150 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 2 Weeks<br />'''Cost''': 140,000 (new), 65,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': Yes<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 7<br />'''Atmosphere''': 350; 1000kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 20 / 0D\n*Scan: 35 / 1D\n*Search: 40 / 2D\n*Focus: 2 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D<br />\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe Rebel Alliance Intelligence has found new uses for the T2 Trainer version and has rebuilt several to serve as long-range couriers. This means stripping the rear cockpit of all controls to make room for an extra 40-kg of cargo, and the fitting of a special canopy to make it possible to jump while in flight without endangering the pilot. This variant, in-officially known as BTLI2, also includes a custom-built power pack made to fit instead of the proton torpedo launcher and its magazine, which increases the craft's endurance to 2 weeks. The Intel version also features the same nav computer as in the A4 and is therefore capable of unlimited jumps, however, the nav computer is placed in an extension of the main cockpit towards the droid and is therefore more susceptible to damage compared to the A4.\n\n==BTL-T2W Y-wing \"Early Warning\"==\n'''T2W Y-wing Early Warning'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-T2W Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Space-borne Early Warning Ship<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D, Sensors 4D, Starfighter Piloting 4D, Starship Gunnery 4D, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week<br />'''Cost''': 165,000 (new), 80,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 0D<br />'''Space''': 5<br />'''Atmosphere''': 295; 850kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Standard Sensor Array\n: Passive: 20 / 0D<br />Scan: 35 / 1D<br />Search: 40 / 2D<br />Focus: 2 / 3D\n*Onboard Early Warning Sensor Array\n: Scan: 90 / 0D<br />Search: 150 / 0D<br />Focus: 4 / 0D\n\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D<br />\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nTo extend the sensor coverage of the fleet, a special variant of the easily modified Y-wing was used. Under Project Cadillac I, the prototype BTL-T2 Trainer was rebuilt to house a sensor array on the back of the main body. To compensate for the increased power demand the proton torpedo launchers were removed and power generators added instead. The sensor equipment was crude and bulky, and the fighter lacked the onboard computing power to shift rapidly through the vast amount of data. Thus, sensor data had to be transmitted back to the carrier where the sensor information was compiled into sensible information. The additional equipment reduced the performance of the already mediocre Ywing to the point where pilots referred to these as \"eggs waiting to be cracked\". Still, they fulfilled a vital role until replaced by E-1 Tracers and other better suited vessels. Many of the carrier fighter wings had at least one flight of these, and some of the squadrons aboard escort frigates also replaced part of their normal fighter complement with a couple of T2W´s. Several where still in service at the time of the Battle of Endor, but most were phased out of service soon after or relegated to second-line duty.\n\n==BTL-T2KC Y-wing \"Tanker\"==\n'''T2KC Y-wing Tanker'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-T2KC Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Tanker<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D, Sensors 4D, Starfighter Piloting 4D, Starship Gunnery 4D, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week + 8 Weeks<br />'''Cost''': 160,000 (new), 70,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 0D<br />'''Space''': 5<br />'''Atmosphere''': 295; 850kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 20 / 0D\n*Scan: 35 / 1D\n*Search: 40 / 2D\n*Focus: 2 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D<br />\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe T2KC is dedicated tanker version, especially designed to refuel fellow starfighters in-flight. It uses the basic hull configuration of the T2W, but replaces the sensor array within the bulbous housing on top of the craft with extra fuel cells, and has a rear mounted boom to transfer fuel to another starfighter equipped with an in-flight refueling receptacle Several of the starfighter wings equipped with Y-wings have a special tanker flight in order to increase combat endurance and prolong reconnaissance patrols.\n\n'''Source:''' UNOFFICIAL\n\n==BTL-S3 Y-wing \"Fighter-Bomber\"==\n'''S3 Y-wing Fighter-bomber'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-S3 Y-wing<br />'''Type''': Fighter-bomber<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Starfighter Piloting 4D+2, Starship Gunnery 4D+1, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week<br />'''Cost''': 135,000 (new), 65,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 7<br />'''Atmosphere''': 350; 1000kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 20 / 0D\n*Scan: 35 / 1D\n*Search: 40 / 2D\n*Focus: 2 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D\n*2 Light Ion Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Turret<br />Crew: 1 (Gunner)<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 3D<br />Space Range: 1-3/7/36<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/0.7/3.6 km<br />Damage: 4D\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 8<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThis is the special attack version of the Y-wing series, and it is based on the BTL-T2 variant but features a rear-looking seat for a gunner and his ion cannon turret.

It is modified for deep-space missions with longer in-flight time. The A4 has weaker shields due to increased power drain from its stronger hyperdrive. Instead it has a reinforced hull. The biggest difference between the S3 and the A4 models is the omission of the gunner. That space is taken up by a nav computer and hyperdrive back-up. The A4 pilot must fix his ion cannon in one position (usually directed forward), and cannot make use of the turret's rotational capabilities.\n\n==BTL-E5 Y-wing \"Wild Weasel\"==\n'''E5 Y-wing Wild Weasel'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-E5 Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Wild Weasel<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-Wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Sensors 4D+2, Starfighter Piloting 5D+1, Starship Gunnery 4D+2, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week<br />'''Cost''': 90,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 7<br />'''Atmosphere''': 350; 1000kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 40 / 0D\n*Scan: 70 / 1D\n*Search: 80 / 2D\n*Focus: 4 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Medium Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 5D\n*2 Light Ion Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Turret<br />Crew: 1 (Gunner)<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 3D<br />Space Range: 1-3/7/36<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/0.7/3.6 km<br />Damage: 4D\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 8<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe first Y-Wings modified for suppression of enemy air defenses where BTL-S3s which became known as BTLE5s. One of the few external signs of conversion was the presence of several antennas on the fuselage, but otherwise they retained the external configuration of the S3 variant. The main difference is the special in-built computer and sensing arrays, which helps to pinpoint threats and is considered vital to its mission profile.\n\nHowever, it can also carry specially adapted equipment on the wing pylons and in the semi-recessed missile housings. The E5 variant of the Y-Wing is also known as the \"Wild Weasel\", since it scurries all over a combat scene, irritating larger enemies and making trouble for smaller. It lacks sufficient internal volume to house more advanced systems and control boxes and was therefore only produced by the field-conversion of some redundant S3s until the advent of the specially designed BTL-E9. The E5 was deployed some months before the Battle of Yavin.\n\n==BTL-A6 Y-wing II \"Recon\"==\n'''A6 Y-wing II Recon'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-A6 Y-wing II<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Long-range Reconnaissance Starfighter<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 1, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Starfighter Piloting 4D+2, Starship Gunnery 4D+1, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 80 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 3 Weeks<br />'''Cost''': 153,000 (new), 76,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Hyperdrive Backup''': x6<br />'''Nav Computer''': Yes<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D+2<br />'''Space''': 8<br />'''Atmosphere''': 365; 1050kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D+2<br />'''Shields''': 1D<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 50 / 0D\n*Scan: 80 / 1D\n*Search: 90 / 2D\n*Focus: 6 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Heavy Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 6D\n*2 Light Ion Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Must be fixed to one facing: front, left, right or rear<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 1D<br />Space Range: 1-3/7/36<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/0.7/3.6 km<br />Damage: 4D\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 12<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe A6 variant of the Y-Wing is also known as the \"Longprobe II\" and is like its predecessor A4, modified for deepspace missions with longer in-flight time.

The Y-Wing Medium Bomber was intended to be the Alliance's best bomber. However, the experiment failed... For the construction of the BTL-M2, they used the basic hull of the first prototype Y-Wings, the BTL-P1 (see above). The front cannons were removed to make place for a small complement of Advanced Torpedoes. These torpedoes have a larger range than normal ones, and also cause heavier damage. The former sensor pod of the BTL-P1 was re-designed to a bombardier's seat, for a second gunner (the bombardier) who operated the torpedoes. So, another three-man vessel was created, whose crew consisted of the pilot and two gunners. However, the Medium Bomber was not without flaws. The fighter was behaved like a sitting duck in space, due to low maneuverability and weak sublight engines, a flaw that could not be compensated by its better shields. Only one squadron of Medium Bombers (12 fighter) was ever produced, as the designers realized that their new ship had more weaknesses than potential. During one of the squadron's first missions half of the squadron was lost in a fight with Imperial patrol forces although the Imperial craft were the minority. All 18 crew members lost their lives. This was a warning to the designers of the BTL-M2, and the project was abandoned. It was given a sad nickname: \"Project Flying Coffin\" The experiment had failed finally. However, the failure contributed to the development of a more secure and much more efficient starfighter, the well-known B-Wing. And so the failed experiment of the BTL-M2 closes the gap between the Y-Wing series and the more modern fighters of the Alliance.\n\n==BTL-U8 Y-wing \"Pinnace\"==\n'''U8 Y-wing Pinnace'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-U8 Y-wing<br />'''Type''': Long-range Pinnace<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.5 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 1<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Starfighter Piloting 4D+2, Starship Gunnery 4D+1, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Passengers''': 3<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 400 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 3 Weeks<br />'''Cost''': 75,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Hyperdrive Backup''': x6<br />'''Nav Computer''': Yes<br />'''Maneuverability''': 1D+1<br />'''Space''': 6<br />'''Atmosphere''': 330; 950kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D+1<br />'''Shields''': 1D<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 40 / 0D\n*Scan: 70 / 1D\n*Search: 80 / 2D\n*Focus: 4 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Light Ion Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Turret<br />Crew: 1 (One Passenger serves as Gunner)<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 3D<br />Space Range: 1-3/7/36<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/0.7/3.6 km<br />Damage: 4D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe BTL-U8 variant (U for Utility) is based on rebuilt Y-Wings and has an enlarged cockpit, which incorporate limited passenger and crew quarters. Its primary mission was to carry vital cargoes and passengers quickly through a high-threat area. The U8 variant of the Y-Wing is also known as the \"Easy Eight\" due to its smooth ride and high standard compared to a real combat-capable Y-Wing. Because of the power drain of its improved hyperdrive engines, the U8 loses some of its deflector shield strength, though the hull is reinforced to compensate. The nose-mounted laser cannons and the proton torpedo launchers are removed. In addition the four semi-recessed missile housings under the belly are plated over. This gives room for more fuel and cargo and a nav computer and hyperdrive backup. By using retired, high-hour Y-Wings, notably A4's, and rebuilding them into fast couriers was it possible to release shuttles and light freighters for other vital duties. The first of this variant was put into service about one year after the Battle of Yavin.\n\n==BTL-E9 Y-wing II \"Wild Weasel\"==\n'''E9 Y-wing II Wild Weasel'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-E9 Y-wing II<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Wild Weasel<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 m<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Sensors 4D+2, Starfighter Piloting 5D+1, Starship Gunnery 4D+2, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week<br />'''Cost''': 180,000 (new), 90,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 8<br />'''Atmosphere''': 350; 1000kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D+1<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 50 / 0D\n*Scan: 80 / 1D\n*Search: 110 / 2D\n*Focus: 6 / 3D\n'''Weapons''': :\n*2 Heavy Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 6D\n*2 Light Ion Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Turret<br />Crew: 1 (Gunner)<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 3D<br />Space Range: 1-3/7/36<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/0.7/3.6 km<br />Damage: 4D\n*1 Sensor Jamming Pod\n: Fire Arc: All<br />Skill: Sensors<br />Fire Control: 4D<br />Space Range: 0-50/-/-<br />Atmosphere Range: 0-100/-/- km<br />Damage: +1D identify, -2D detect\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 12<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe BTL-E9 is based on the S7 variant and its primary mission is to escort other starfighters on strike missions, and make it easier for them to survive by jamming enemy sensors and com gear. Another important function is its capability to target the enemy's fire control by using HARM missiles. The E9 has a special in-built computer and sensing array, which helps to pinpoint threats and is considered vital to its mission profile. It has a permanently attached belly capsule which contain jamming equipment and carries other mission-variable equipment on the wing pylons and in the semirecessed missile housings. This equipment reduces the maneuverability plus the speed when traveling in atmosphere. Another drawback is that the E9's jammer shines like a beacon on a capital ship screens. This variant was issued to front-line squadrons about one year after the Battle of Yavin.\n\n==BTL-T10 Y-wing II \"Trainer\"==\n'''T10 Y-wing II Trainer'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-T10 Y-wing II<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Trainer<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 16.0 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': 2, 1 astromech droid (can coordinate)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Astrogation 3D+2, Starfighter Piloting 4D+2, Starship Gunnery 4D+1, Starship Shields 3D<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 110 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week<br />'''Cost''': 140,000 (new), 70000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses astromech droid)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D+2<br />'''Space''': 8<br />'''Atmosphere''': 365; 1050kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D+1<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 25 / 0D\n*Scan: 50 / 1D\n*Search: 75 / 2D\n*Focus: 3 / 3D\n'''Weapons''':\n*2 Heavy Laser Cannons (fire-linked)\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1-3/12/25<br />Atmosphere Range: 0.1-0.3/1.2/2.5 km<br />Damage: 6D\n*2 Proton Torpedo Launchers\n: Fire Arc: Front<br />Skill: Starship Gunnery<br />Ammo: 12<br />Fire Control: 2D<br />Space Range: 1/3/7<br />Atmosphere Range: 50-100/300/700<br />Damage: 9D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThis is the special trainer version of the Y-Wing II series, and features a forward-looking seat for a second pilot, who normally is the instructor. In order to improve visibility, the ion cannon turret removed and the cockpit slightly enlarged. Apart from being used as an operational trainer, it is also in use as a forward observer. In this type of mission it carries special target designator pods and transmits its signals back to capital ships or other starfighter squadrons. This variant was put into service some time before the Battle of Endor and is one of the standard trainers in use by the New Republic.\n\n==BTL-D11 Y-wing \"Drone\"==\n'''D11 Y-wing Drone'''<br />'''Craft''': Koensayr BTL-D11 Y-wing<br />'''Source''': Unofficial<br />'''Type''': Remote-Controlled Target Drone<br />'''Scale''': Starfighter<br />'''Length''': 15.7 meters<br />'''Skill''': Starfighter Piloting: Y-wing<br />'''Crew''': (1)<br />'''Crew Skill''': Depends on user<br />'''Cargo Capacity''': 400 kg<br />'''Consumables''': 1 Week<br />'''Cost''': 25,000 (used)<br />'''Hyperdrive Multiplier''': x1<br />'''Nav Computer''': None (uses slave-link)<br />'''Maneuverability''': 2D<br />'''Space''': 7<br />'''Atmosphere''': 350; 1000kmh<br />'''Hull''': 4D<br />'''Shields''': 1D+2<br />'''Sensors''':\n*Passive: 20 / 0D\n*Scan: 35 / 1D\n*Search: 40 / 2D\n*Focus: 2 / 3D\n\n'''Capsule:'''\n\nThe New Republic found itself with large numbers of old, time-expired YWings a couple of years after the Battle of Endor, and therefore initiated a program of converting some of them into target drones for live target practice. Usable parts such as weapons were removed and a remote control system was installed. The D11 can either be piloted normally (for ferry missions) or flown by an astromech droid or controlled by ground-station data-link. Apart from being used for target practice and live weapons test, the Y-wing Drone has also seen use as an improvised missile. In the latter case, every available space within the fighter was packed with high explosives and the generators wired for overload. The Drone was then piloted by either an on-board astromech droid programmed for suicide missions or remotely guided by a pilot on another ship. Known instances were this modification was used is for example during the Battle of Calamari, when every available resource was used to combat the attacking World Devastators.\n\n'''Game Terms''': When used as an improvised missile, the Y-wing Drone has a damage rating of 10D, capital-scale. It will explode if damaged more than lightly.",
