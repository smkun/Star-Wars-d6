It had a much larger capacity and was bulkier than other landing craft, and possessed extensive communications and sensor systems.\n\nAfter landing and deploying its troops and vehicles, the IF-120's interior could convert from transport configuration into a fully-functional mobile command base until the area was secured for larger and more permanent command facilities.\n\nA landing craft was captained by Drezzel, an Imperial assigned to explore the Seoul system. This ship was still under Drezzel's command following the Battle of Endor and Emperor Palpatine's death. Drezzel continued to serve the Empire under an Imperial Governor. However, the ship and Drezzel were destroyed during an accident involving the native Seoularian crystals.",
