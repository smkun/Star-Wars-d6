It was a heavy, fast, \"flying guns\"-platform. With its 8 autoblasters, it could easily guard convoys of otherwise defenseless bulk freighters and commerce craft.\n\nDesigned with military requirements, it was nonetheless reasonably priced on the civil market. Originally, the VCX-820 was designed for the Imperial Remnant, but invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong caused many smugglers and private traders to seek out a vessel that would allow for protected travel through profitable, yet highly dangerous, space lanes. As a result of this desire, many larger trade-firms invested in these vessels, making it quite common during the hard times of the New Republic.",
