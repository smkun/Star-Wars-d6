The Blade is a small dual role fighter craft, primarily designed to operate within the atmosphere of a planet. However, its performance in space allows it compete, albeit poorly, with more modern fighters. The ship is armed only with two light laser cannons, and though not as powerful as most ship weapons they provide enough punch for a ship of its size. The Blade can be seen in the service of planetary security forces throughout the Argolas sector.",
