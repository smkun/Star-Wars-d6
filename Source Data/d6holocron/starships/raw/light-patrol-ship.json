This craft is more commonly encountered Coreward instead of Rimward. More SFS Light Patrol Ships comprise the Ringali Shell Security Forces than any other type of craft in their fleet. Due to the somewhat lacking shielding and maneuverability ratings of this craft, the Ringali Shell Security Forces favors to send out Light Patrol Ships in trios. Interestingly, although the Light Patrol Ship is not available for sale, it is known that bounty hunters have acquired this craft to ply their trade. This triple decked design positions two of its laser turrets dorsally, while the remaining one is positioned ventrally.",
