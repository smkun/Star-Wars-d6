While not quite an \"ugly,\" these ships were custom manufactured by modifying an old TIE production facility under Tavira's control. It began with the basic TIE ball cockpit and Twin Ion Engines, and altered the solar panel structures to feature a trio of blades set 120 degrees apart, with the bottom two solar panels serving as landing gear. It retained its dual laser cannons mounted beneath the cockpit, but added an ion cannon from below the top solar panel. They had basic shields to keep them on par with most other starfighters (a definite bonus, considering their limited supply), and since the solar panels were arranged differently, the sides of the cockpit had been altered to add viewports, giving the pilot more visibility than in a normal TIE craft. New Republic fighter pilots gave the starfighter the nickname \"clutch,\" because the solar panels seem to be clutching the ball cockpit between them",
