It was sturdy and reasonably well-armed for a scout ship.\n\nThe ship had a design flaw concerning its ion engines, the two left engines being prone to shutting down when stressed by complex maneuvering. If this occurred, the ship would possibly fall into a dangerous spin.\n\nThey were used extensively by the Republic Astrogation Survey Team in uncharted space. In such missions, they had only a 3% failure rate. They were also popular with independent scouts and explorers due to their low cost and spacious interiors. They often served as mobile homes for entire families.",
