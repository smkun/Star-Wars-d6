First introduced after the Clone Wars, the cruiser was the premier warship of the Rendili Star Drive corporation, ideally suited to the budgets and needs of local governments and corporate manufacturing worlds.\n\nDuring the galactic civil war, many of these vessels were appropriated by the Alliance and used against the Empire. The ships are currently used by the Republic to deliver badly needed protection.\n\nThe bulk cruiser has a number of flaws which were demonstrated during the galactic civil war. The warship is slow, moderately old, expensive to keep fueled, and subject to constant breakdown. The Alliance found that it was more cost efficient to convert the cruisers to starfighter launch platforms than to try to keep them battle ready. Those which have not been converted are used as transport escorts by the New Republic. A few have even been spotted in the Imperial fleet, which has made a habit of capturing warships and conscripting them into Imperial service.\n\n'''Source''': Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook (pages 211, 214), Dark Force Rising Sourcebook (page 136)",
