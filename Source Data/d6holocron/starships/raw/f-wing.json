In game terms when the fighter is heavily damaged, a roll of 1-2 (used to determine which system is damaged) means the stabilization system has failed. Reduce all fire control codes by 1D (since the craft is no longer a stable firing platform Sublight speed drops from 6 to 2 (atmospheric speed goes from 330;950 kmh to 225;650kmh). These penalties are cumulative.<br />\n\n(2) This Capital ship scale turbolaser consumes far too much power for the StarFighter to supply so is charged from capacitors, this means that unless the capacitors are recharged from a Capital Scale vessel, the TurboLaser can only be fired twice in any 24 hour period.<br />\n\n'''Description''': The F Wing is a direct replacement for the B Wing fighter which performed so well during the Battle of Endor and during the years of the formation of the New Republic. The F Wing is designed with the same role as the B Wing, that of a Fighter Bomber and Capital ship interdiction fighter. It performs these duties with in almost exactly the same way as the B Wing, but has the added edge of its capital scale turbolaser which actually allow it to stand a chance of taking on capital ships.\n\n'''Source''': www.RPGGamer.org",
