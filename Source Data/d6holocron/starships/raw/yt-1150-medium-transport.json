Slender and long, this ship looks like a loaf of bread sliced lengthwise along each side; essentially, a long, slender center section with two engine nacelles on either side providing thrust.\n\nThe ship saw a good amount of use during the days of the Galactic Republic and, as like most CEC designs, it is easily modified. Almost nothing in the ship's design, save for a few core systems, is unalterable, and smugglers, pirates, merchants, and other spacefaring entrepreneurs have taken advantage of this and turned their ships into a personalized transports that suit their needs perfectly.",
