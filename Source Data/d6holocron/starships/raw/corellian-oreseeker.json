The ship is a combination bewteen a scout ship and a mining ship. Its mission profile is to search for heavy ore depots in asteroid fields for example. Therefore the ship is equipped with a good sensor suite but also features strong hull an shields as asteroid fields are dangerous places for starships. If the ship is in direct danger by approaching astroid particles which could cause damage to the ship, a hevay laser cannon fires the asteroid part in small pieces.\nOnce arrived in an asteroid field, the sensors begin to search for ore everywhere in the asteroid field and guides the ship to the largest depot. Then different samples from different locations are taken for the mining company and are stored in the ship's cargo bay. If the company is satisfied with the results they send in larger ships to mine the field, guided by the OreSeekers. Of course the superiour features made these ships popular among independant traders as well, as especially the large cargo hold gurantees a good profit.",
