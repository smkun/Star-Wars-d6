As it uses powered-down laser cannons, the ship has more room for increased sublight speed, shields and atmospheric speed. Unfortunately the ship does not carry a Hyperdrive, or Nav computer. As yet, the imperial overloards, have not used them against the Vong, but many are ‘itching’ to see what they can do against then. In all the simulations, they have out performed many of the new republic fighters when against Coral skippers and Vong frigate analogs. The onboard cargo space contains enough ammo for the chain gun for 16 continuous rounds of fire, or 36 bursts.\n\n'''Source:''' David \"Garhkal\" Stairs",
