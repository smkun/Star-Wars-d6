It has not the capacities to fully repair a seriously damaged starship. However most important starship systems can be fixed to an acceptable degree (See list below for possible repairs). There are 510 highly trained mechanics aboard the ship. The dry-dock of the ship can be divided in up to three parts, depending on how many ships do need a repair. The maximum length of the dry-dock, if it remains in one part, is 510 meters. If two parts are needed, one section is 170 meters long and the second section 340 meters. If the dock is converted into three parts, these have 170 meters in length each. So it's not possible to repair, for example, three ''Strike''-class Cruisers at the same time, as this would require a dry-dock of 1,350 meters. The sections of the dry-dock depend on the size of the ship which is to be repaired (see list below).\n\n'''Before you start:'''\nOf course, it is possible that the mechanics aboard have a bad day and so the repairs cannot be done. But it's also possible that the needed replacement parts are not available.\n\nTo avoid this cases, roll a D6 before the repairs begin. Here's a list of what happens if the dice shows a ...\n*1 - Essential replacement parts are not available. The repairs cannot be done.\n*2 - 5 - The repairs can be done as scheduled.\n*6 - The mechanics have a very good day: The repairs receive an extra bonus (see below).\n\n'''Repair Capacities:'''\nThe following repairs can be done by the repair crew (510 mechanics) of the ship:\n\n'''Large Repairs:'''\n*1/2 of the ship's hull code (maximum 2D/200 hull points)\n*1/2 of the ship's maneuverability (maximum 1D)\n*+2 sublight speed/1 speed category (only if more than +2/1 speed category got lost in the battle)\n'''Small repairs''':\n*1/2 of the ship's shield code (maximum 1D/100 shield points)\n*Replace a destroyed hyperdrive with a x3 auxiliary unit\n*completely repair the ship's sensors\n*completely repair the ship's life support systems\n*completely repair damaged, destroyed or ionized control systems\n===='''Repair bonus in case of a thrown \"6\"'''====\n*Hull: maximum +2D+2/260 hull points\n*Shields: maximum +1D+2/160 shield points\n*+3 sublight speed maximum/2 speed categories\n'''Dry-dock combinations:'''\nThe duration of the repairs which is listed below in the table is for large repairs. You can combine two small repairs to a large repair, that means that the duration of a large repair is equivalent to the duration of two small repairs. Example: A hull repair for a large ship that needs all three sections of the dry-dock is a large repair and thus needs the full 3 days to be repaired. A shield repair and a sensor repair, which are both small repairs, would only need 3 days to be repaired, as well, although they are repaired at the same time.\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"border\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"3\" width=\"500\"|'''First Case: 1 ship in the docks'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|'''Sections needed'''\n|'''Mechanics assigned'''\n|'''Duration of repairs (in days)'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #1\n|- align=\"center\"\n|3\n|510\n|3\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2\n|510\n|2\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1\n|510\n|1\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"border\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"6\" width=\"500\"|'''Second Case: 2 ships in the docks'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"2\"|'''Sections needed'''\n| colspan=\"2\"|'''Mechanics assigned'''\n| colspan=\"2\"|'''Duration of repairs (in days)'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #2\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #2\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #2\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2\n|1\n|340\n|170\n|3\n|3\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1\n|1\n|255\n|255\n|2\n|2\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"border\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"9\" width=\"500\"|'''Third Case: 3 ships in the docks'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"3\"|'''Sections needed'''\n| colspan=\"3\"|'''Mechanics assigned'''\n| colspan=\"3\"|'''Duration of repairs (in days)'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #2\n|Ship #3\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #2\n|Ship #3\n|Ship #1\n|Ship #2\n|Ship #3\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|170\n|170\n|170\n|3\n|3\n|3-\n|}",
