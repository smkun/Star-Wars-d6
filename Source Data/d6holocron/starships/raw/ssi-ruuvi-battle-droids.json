When acting on their own, and merely relaying data back to Ssi-ruuvi cruisers, battle droids have the following skill die codes: starfighter piloting 5D, starship gunnery 4D+1, starship shields 4D+2.\n\n'''Weapon Damage:''' A single laser cannon does 3D damage. Two or three of the cannons may be linked together to do 4D damage, while all four weapons may be linked for 5D damage. Fire-linking these weapons can be accomplished automatically.\n\n'''Energy Absorption:''' If a battle droid is hit by an incoming laser or turbolaser blast (does not apply for ion cannons, tractor beams, concussion missiles or proton torpedoes) and the intelligence controlling the shields makes a Moderate starship shields roll, the micro-filament grid has been properly aligned to absorb part of the incoming energy. If this is successful, on the next round an extra 1D may be added to either shields or weapon damage or the droids speed can be improved to Space 11, Atmosphere: 435; 1,250 kmh for one round. If the ship is heavily damaged or worse, the mico-filament grid is overloaded and the energy in not absorbed.\n\n'''Sensor Tracking:''' The highly-radioactive exhaust of Ssi-ruuvi battle droids makes them easy to track. Enemy sensor operators get a +2D bonus to sensors when searching for and tracking these ships.\n\n'''Source:''' Truce At Bakura Sourcebook (page .....)",
