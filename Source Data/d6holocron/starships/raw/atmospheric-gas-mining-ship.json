Each Garman-class ship could transport up to twenty skimmers, and had a series of collection tanks which were used to store the gases collected by the skimmers from gas giant planets. These ships required a crew of 300 officers and four gunners, and could transport up to twenty passengers and 70,000 metric tons of cargo. To protect themselves from pirates, the Garman-class ships were armed with four quad laser cannons.",
