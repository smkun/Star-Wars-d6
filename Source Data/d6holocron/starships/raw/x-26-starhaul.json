It required a crew of two, plus a droid. A Starhaul had space for 5,000 metric tons of cargo and a single week's worth of consumables.\n\nIn atmosphere, this vessel could only achieve 200 kilometers per hour. It also was equipped with a Class 4 hyperdrive.\n\nThough unshielded, the craft was armed with one double laser cannon turret.",
