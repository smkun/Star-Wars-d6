They have also been known to be used for piracy, in transporting high risk goods. The Corellian Interceptor was first put on the market about 5 years after the Corvette came out. It is a basic patrol craft that has been in service since the Old Republic. They are not as common outside the Corellia system as of the Battle of Yavin. However, some very distant systems produced their own versions. It, like the Corvette, is a workhorse easily adapted to many uses.\n\n'''Source''': \"Unknown\"",
