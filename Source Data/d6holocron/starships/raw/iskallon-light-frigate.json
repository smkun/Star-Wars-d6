The ship looks like some giant moss-covered stone; spherical, yet covered with so many irregularities on its surface that it hardly looks round. From the rear of the ship juts a plane which houses the engines and which seems to be held in place by large supports. These come off the surface of the sphere and are secured on the top and bottom surfaces of the plane.\n\nIntermittently, chunks of machinery and equipment spring from the ship's surface at random intervals as though they might simply have been dropped there and were never swept away.",
