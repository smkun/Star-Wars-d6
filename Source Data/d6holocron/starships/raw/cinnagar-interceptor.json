In the days of the Old Republic, the Interceptor was a formidable starfighter capable of rendering incoming threats harmless within moments. While not the most powerful starfighter ever, the Interceptor was quick and often deployed in large numbers in order to overwhelm any opposition. Other planets adopted design philosophies of the Interceptor, such as speed and rapid-fire lasers, and during the dangerous times when the Republic squaring off with the Sith Empire, such ships became invaluable in warding off threats to a planet's security.The ship boasts a strange, arachnid-like design which spreads four wings out, each tipped with a moderately powered laser cannon. Beneath the cockpit rests a single ion cannon, fitting for most planetary defense starfighters, which could also be fire-linked to the laser cannons for added efficiency. The ship was moderately shielded, though its hull was nothing out of the ordinary for starfighters of the time.\n\nAdditionally, the ship boasted impressive speed both when in space, as well as in the atmosphere, due to an advanced ion engine which had been developed specifically for the Cinnagar Interceptor.",
