It used the same forward cockpit structure as the much larger YV-100 light freighter.\n\nUnlike most CEC freighters, which came off the assembly lines with minimal weaponry, the YV-929 was designed from the start to be heavily armed for defense against pirate and Rebel raids, and also featured very strong shields.\n\nThe YV-929 was armed with two dual light turbolasers, dual ion cannon turret beneath the cockpit, two triple blasters mounted on stubby wings, and eight concussion missile launchers, half of which fired to the aft.\n\nDespite its compact size and heavy armament, the YV-929 was still able to carry 150 metric tons of cargo.\n\nNot surprisingly, the YV-929 was often used by the very Rebels and pirate groups it was designed to defend against. The second most common user of the design was the Corporate Sector Authority.",
