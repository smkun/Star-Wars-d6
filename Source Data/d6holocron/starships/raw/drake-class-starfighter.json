Despite being a relatively common craft in the days of the Old Republic, few remained in service beyond the Clone Wars. The craft were light, fast, and a little flimsy, but did in fact boast a small shield generator which allowed it to take some damage and survive the rougher space lanes in the galaxy. Kuat Systems Engineering even made a gift of a dozen of the first starfighters off the assembly line, one full squadron, to the Jedi Order for their use as couriers and negotiators.",
