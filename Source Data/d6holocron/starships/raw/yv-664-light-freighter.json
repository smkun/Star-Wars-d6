It was regarded by many as having a good balance of cargo capacity, durability, and speed.\n\nThe ship had the saucer-like shape of the YT series, giving it the ability to move around easily. The YV-664 had many similarities to the YT-1300 light freighter, such as the cockpit style and engine configuration, though a few differences from past models existed.",
