This design of vessel sold only moderately well, with it being too large and expensive for owner captains to buy, but too small for the bulk transport companies to use. However it has made a successful life in the second hand market where it makes a large and comfortable living for the captain who buys a used YB-300 rather than a newer light freighter. With plenty of room for modifications, and a large hold to hide smuggling compartments within, many of these vessels now find themselves operating as the ships of smugglers and pirates.",
