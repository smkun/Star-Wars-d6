They were equipped with twin engines at the rear and a belly-mounted sensor array. The ships were purposely designed to protect ships from pirates, and came equipped with multiple laser cannons, quad laser cannons, and a single proton torpedo launcher. To satisfy regulations that these ships could not be used by pirates, the ship had slow sublight speed making it useless for raids. Though the ship was used by many organizations, including Hutts and a number of crime lords, it was never used in a direct act of piracy.",
