These vessels were designed to carry a full standard Army Corps, regardless of the specific type of corps. Additionally, the ships were built with the possibility of expansion in mind, in order to allow for some expansion in the size of a standard corps.\n\nShortly after 0 BBY Evakmar-KDY transports were considered to be amongst the newest vessels in the Imperial Navy. At the time, the ships were typically deployed in troop lines consisting of a pair of the transports, and a pair of escort vessels - typically Strike cruisers.\n\nThe Evakmar-KDY transport was also frequently used by the Imperial Navy's Fleet Technical Services in order to transport large numbers of technicians to wherever they were needed. In this role, each transport was usually accompanied by two escort frigates.\n\nThe August can land 6,708 fully equipped troopers and 583 combat vehicles at one time using all of it's 52 support craft. In addition, the August has 24 TIE/In's to provide escort to the surface and 12 TIE Bombers to provide direct combat support. The August also has an impressive array of firepower with it's turbolaser emplacements and it's anti-starfighter system.",
