The ship had the familiar saucer-shaped hull of the YT-1300, but lacked the forward cargo loading mandibles that gave that ship its familiar outline. It also included two sensors protruding from the bow, which could be big, tempting targets for anyone attacking the YT-1210.\n\nThe YT-1210 was 28 meters in length, and the standard crew consisted of a pilot and a gunner. The stock YT-1210 could carry up to 100 metric tons of cargo, and was armed with a single laser cannon. The ship had a small cabin for the captain, and it came equipped with a small refresher station. Of course, individual YT-1210 could be, and were modified by their owners.\n\nYT-1210 was the main production light freighter from Corellian Engineering Corporation, until the YT-1300 arrived. Unfortunately, once sales of the YT-1300 took off at some point before 33 BBY, the highly capable YT-1210 freighter had a shortened production run. The YT-1210 was not a poor design, but it was not on par with the speed of YT-1300 and it lacked some of the amenities that the YT-1300 had. Still, the YT-1210, like its more popular successor, could be found throughout the galaxy.",
