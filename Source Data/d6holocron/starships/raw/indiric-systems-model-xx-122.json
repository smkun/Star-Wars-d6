It looks like an earthen based A-10 Warthog mated with a Tie bomber, but is very rugged and good at its job.  Since the founding of the planet and the Indiric systems corporation by the Empire, these ships have slowly been getting modified up to their current specs for use in both atmospheric flight and space combat.  However cause of its cost and crew requirements, the empire has NOT purchased any for the imperial army or navy.  Though the Rebellion has acquired a few individual ships..",
