Even the engines experienced a bonus from this reconfiguration. The end result was a very fast and maneuverable vessel that was well armed for a ship its size.\n\nThe Enforcer-class was designed by Sienar Fleet Systems and Kuat Drive Yards engineers located in the Pentastar Alignment at the behest of Grand Moff Ardus Kaine, but the vessels were manufactured at the Galentro Heavy Works shipyards at Jaemus. The ship was born out of Kaine's desire to quickly rebuild fleet strength.\n\nAlthough labeled as a picket, the cruiser served as the frontline vessel of Kaine's resource-strapped fleet. These ships were deployed mostly in pairs. Formations based on this number became more common as Kaine's forces continued to grow, so sightings of four or six ships working in tandem became more common.",
