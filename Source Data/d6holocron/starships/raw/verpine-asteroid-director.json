It was a 10-meter long energy conversion thruster which vaporized dross from mining by means of controlled fusion reaction, creating thrust, moving asteroids (such as into place for mining or out of shipping lanes). A single director could move an asteroid massing up to 50 metric tons; larger asteroids were moved by remotely-linked directors placed at intervals. The directors were sometimes used to arrange asteroids into \"natural\" defense networks or to \"drop\" asteroids on un-shielded worlds. A unit cost 12,500 credits and was operated by a single pilot.",
