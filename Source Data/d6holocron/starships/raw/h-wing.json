Even so, the number that entered service was expected to remain low, as almost any two single-seated starfighters could be purchased for the same price as a single H-Wing.\n\nThe H-Wing was a stable weapons platform capable of delivering a rather hard-hitting punch; only the B-Wing was more heavily armed. The fighter's primary long-range weapon was its medium laser cannon which was mounted in a fully rotating dorsal turret. The weapon could only be fired from the turret's gunnery chair; no fire control for the main weapon was included in the piloting cockpit; a design flaw meaning that, if the gunner was incapacitated, or indeed was not there, the primary weapon could not be used.\n\n'''Source''':\n*Challenge 35 (Magazine pages 58-59)\n*[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/BTS-A2_Long-Range_Strike_Fighter/Bomber Wookieepedia: BTS-A2 Long-Range Strike Fighter/Bomber]",
