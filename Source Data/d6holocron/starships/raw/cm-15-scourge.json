The three laser cannons are spread evenly along the fuselage, with the missile tube laying flush with the starfighter’s belly.The first prototype of the CM-15 “Scourge” was completed just prior to the T-65 X-Wing’s release by Incom. Although a stable craft with decent performance and adequate armament, its performance was still lackluster in comparison with Incom’s entry. Especially disappointing was the Scourge’s distinct lack of an astromech interface. While there was some local interest, production figures were modest at best. The project was eventually scrapped, with the remaining stock put up for sale at reduced prices. These days, the CM-15 is often found in the arsenals of small corporations, smugglers, and pirates.",
