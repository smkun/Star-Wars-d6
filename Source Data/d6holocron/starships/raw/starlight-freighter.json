It proved to be the last design produced by Rendili-Surron. \n\nThe Starlight-class was designed in the shape of a flying wing, measuring thirty-four meters in length. The cockpit was located at one end of the curved wing, with a turret-mounted blaster cannon mounted on the opposite end. The vessel could carry up to four passengers (not including the one pilot for the crew), and fifty metric tons of cargo. Its interior was spartan with limited living space.",
