There are larger container ships like the Super Transport XI, able to hold 25 million metric tons of cargo, but nevertheless, the Super Transport VII is one of the larger container vessels in space. Although the ship is big and slow, it is a very efficient way to transport lots of cargo. Because of the ship's size and shape, it is unable to land on planets and so has to be supported by shuttles and other small craft. Like most other large transports, the Super Transport VII, too, has no weapons at all and is not well-armored. Therefore these ships are often accompanied by escort vessels.",
