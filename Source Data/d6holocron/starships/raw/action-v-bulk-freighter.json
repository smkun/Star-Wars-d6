Action V freighters couldn't carry as much cargo as the newer Action VI transports, but were also less expensive, and could be found throughout the galaxy in the ownership of private individuals and freelance traders.\n\nThe Action V was the most popular of the series, despite the fact that its Class 4 hyperdrive was slower than the Class 3 used in both its predecessor and successor. \n\nDue to its shape, the Action V was sometimes referred to as a \"flying hatbox,\" as Wedge Antilles pointed out to Mara Jade.",
