Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi stowed away on one during the invasion of Naboo.\n*'''Body''' Strength: If the tensor field generators of the ship are destroyed, the Body Strength of the lander drops to 2D, and if grounded, it will be unable to take off without collapsing under its own weight. In the air, if the generators are disabled, the ship will fall apart in 1D minutes... in other words, once those tensor fields are down, the ship had better land fast, because it's falling apart and can't survive many hits!",
