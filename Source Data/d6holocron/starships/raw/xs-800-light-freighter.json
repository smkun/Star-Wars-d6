Personal refresher stations, independent climate control for each quarters, and fold-out bunks made it a very comfortable ship for long journeys.\n\nTwo escape pods capable of each seating five people are equipped on the XS-800. Also, the cockpit was designed to separate from the ship and land on a planet when there was no other way to rescue passengers and crew. Safety was also guaranteed by its double laser cannon.\n\nIt was a very successful craft, but not as popular as other Corellian Engineering Corporation ships, like the CR90 corvette.",
