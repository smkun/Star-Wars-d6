This remote piloting option, combined with the design choice to forgo thick hull plating for shield generators, demonstrated a Ssi-ruuvi intention to sacrifice the picket ships where tactically necessary.\n\nThe Fw’sen-class took the ovoid overlapping shell shape of other Ssi-Ruuvi starships, although it featured a set of four small wings for stabilization during atmospheric flight. \n\nDuring the Bakura Incident, and subsequent Battle of Bakura, the Ssi-Ruuk fielded twenty Fw’sen-class picket ships. The Imperial defenses destroyed five of the ships during the preliminary battle, while the rest were destroyed or captured by the Rebel Alliance relief force that arrived to rescue Bakura. Years later, Fw’sen-class picket ships were used during a second invasion of Bakura.",
