It also had a secure hold which was why it was used by many as a bounty vessel.\n\n'''History'''<br />The Aggressor assault fighters were used by Mandalorian Protectors during the Second Battle of Fondor and by Jedi turned Mandalorian Bardan Jusik.\n\n'''Source''': [http://www.rancorpit.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3731&highlight=trilon+assault+fighter www.RancorPit.com/forums]",
