Additionally, increased tension between the planet's government and the Trade Federation over payment for shipping lommite off the planet have only increased the tension felt by the mining world. The Dorvalla Space Corps consists of a few small squadrons of locally-built starfighters, with pilots who rotate out on shifts so that they can have other jobs while still leaving someone on duty. The starfighters are fixed-winged and blunt-nosed, resembling a bludgeon with a handle as opposed to the sleeker, more, artistic designs found throughout the cultural centers of the galaxy.",
