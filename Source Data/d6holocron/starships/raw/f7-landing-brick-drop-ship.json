While longer than the MT/191, the F7 had only a single deck capable of carrying a platoon into combat. It was also even less aerodynamic than the MT/191, earning the F7 its unflattering nickname.\n\nThe F7 made up for it by having a larger cargo capacity, superior engines, defensive and offensive systems, as well as a permanent ceramic coating as opposed to the MT/191's VACX. In emergencies the F7 was often pressed into combat air support, though it was more normally used transporting Imperial regular and special forces.",
