It was the predecessor to the Action series of medium freighters, and defined the basic shape of that transport. The BD-27 measured 110 meters in length, and its automated systems required only a pilot and co-pilot to operate. However, it required extensive maintenance. The ship had no weapons and weak shields. The entire ship could be connected to a cargo module capable of carrying 75,000 metric tons. The BD-27 was quickly replaced by larger bulk freighters, and was relegated to use in small operations.",
