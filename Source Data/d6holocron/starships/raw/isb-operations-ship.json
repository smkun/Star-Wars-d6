Another - yet not very familiar - variant is used by the Imperial Security Bureau, the infamous branch of the Imperial Navy. Such ships are used when ISB agents are on secret undercover missions, what is usually the case. Therefore the ship has been refittet with a light sensor stealth. Seen from the exterior, there are no differences to the Guardian-class cruisers, only some interior modifications have been made. The crew size has been reduced, thus making place for a small boarding party of two squads. Increased sublight speed and sensor setalth guarantee an efficient operating during the missions.",
