As such it is a highly pecialised craft.&nbsp; The bulk of the price goesin the state of the art scientific equipment, including: sensitive spectral scanners, magnetometers, IR and UV scanners, laser core samplers among others. These craft also always have two modified B1<br />Worker droids, equipped specifically for the current mission.&nbsp; The tractor beam is used primarily for taking samples without having to land the craft, and the laser is barely adequate for defensive purposes.<br /> The ship's design was a challenge for Elrood Star Yardsengineers, having to incorporate large carrying capacity, long range and high stability to protect the delicate instruments on board. As such, the final design was also suitable for luxury craft and other purposes. Versions of this craft, stripped of their scientific equipment can be bought from Elrood Star Yards for re-fitting as the buyer sees fit.",
