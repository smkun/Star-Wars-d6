Internally, its holds could be adapted to various pressures and climates with individual configurations. \n\nEven though each ship was sold without any weaponry or defensive shields built in, plenty of after-market systems could be added to the Action IV.\n\nDuring the time of the Galactic Republic, the Action IV transport Azure Queen was captured by Black Sun pirates, while en route to the planet Rutan.\n\nThe Imperial Navy refitted a number of them as Imperial Patrol Ships.",
