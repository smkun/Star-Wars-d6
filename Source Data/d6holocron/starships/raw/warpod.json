The controls are just inside the main airlock. Roll the target ship’s hull -2D; if the torches roll scores a “lightly damaged” result, it has breached the hull. Once the hull is breached, the torch requires a full minute to cut a one-meter-wide-by-two-meter-high hole. The extendable boarding tube attaches to the hull and forms and airtight seal in 30 seconds.\n\n'''Capsule''': The Ulig Abaha Ltd. #2 Warpod, or warpod pinnace, was a starfighter used by the Corporate Sector Authority. They were also used by the Pirates of Iridium before their defeat in 22 BBY.\n\nThe 20-meter long Warpod was crewed by a pilot and four gunners who operated the two laser cannon turrets and the bottom-mounted cutting torch. It was capable of going toe-to-toe with older designs from the Galactic Republic, but newer designs like the TIE/ln starfighter or T-65 X-wing starfighter were vastly superior to the #2 Warpod.\n\nPirates in or around the Corporate Sector sometimes used Warpods.",
