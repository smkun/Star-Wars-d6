It could carry up to 400 tons of cargo and was well defended with 10 quad laser cannons. \n\nIn remote, low priority systems of the Corporate Sector, the CSA Security Division used modified Etti Lighters, equipped with upgraded power generators and turbolasers, as anti-smuggling patrol craft. Han Solo and Chewbacca encountered one of these modified Etti Lighters at Duroon.\n\nThe Skandrei Bandits, pirates who operated within the Kathol Outback during the early years of the New Republic, operated modified versions of these vessels.",
