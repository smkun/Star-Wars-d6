Although it shares an indirect design lineage with the X-wing, the Crossfire is noticeably different in its configuration, with its four S-foils in front of a bulky fuselage rather than on its sides. The back S-foil could rotate, folding away for landing and dropping down for combat to form a cross-shaped configuration; this wing was particularly thin so that it would not obstruct the pilot's forward view. In attack position, the wing mounted laser cannons fired in an intersecting cross pattern, giving them longer reach than most Starfighter based weapons.<br />\n\nThe pilot controlled the fighter from an enclosed cockpit module in the rear of ship which was entirely sealed off from the rest of the vessel and also contained its sublight drive. In case of being shot down or some other emergency, the pilot would eject by disengaging the module from the rest of the fighter and use the sublight drive to steer towards safety. While cramped, the cockpit module was big enough for two beings, with a second seat facing the modules rearward for an optional gunner, who would control the rear-mounted laser cannons, in a configuration similar to the Snowspeeders the Rebel Alliance used on Hoth. However, because of the limited firing arc of the back guns, and because the craft was prone to executing high speed maneuvers in combat, thus giving the gunner limited opportunities to fire back at pursuing craft, Crossfires very rarely had gunners assigned to them.<br />",
