Only a craft with more ordnance capacity and durability than a starfighter can hit hard and precisely enough to devastate the enemy. Because of this change in Imperial Naval doctrine, IMS has developed the B-9 \"Scorpion\" Precision Heavy Bomber.\n\nOnce delivered to the field of battle, the Scorpion can use numerous missiles and bombs to destroy a range of craft. With the Scorpion's 18 hardpoint ordnance bay as its prime weapon, it is best suited for the elimination of heavily armored targets, such as starships, thick bunkers, and shields. The Scorpion can also serve as a defense craft, however, carrying several missiles and torpedoes in a standoff capacity. By no means does this make it a starfighter, however.\n\nThanks to its thick armor plating, the Scorpion's speed is balanced with durability. It also sports a double laser turret for point defense against enemy starfighters. To combat enemy starfighter attacks, the Scorpion has a powerful area targeting jammer. Though it affects all starfighters in its range, both friend and foe, and doesn't affect capital ship targeting arrays (they have enough power to punch through it), the jammer is an invaluable tool to help the Scorpion accomplish its objectives. With all of its capabilities, the Scorpion precision bomber at present rivals all others in the field of starship assault technology.Tactical Deployment: The Scorpion is intended to be deployed with full starfighter escort, preferably TIE Interceptors or TIE Avengers. The double laser cannon is not intended as an offensive weapon, and the Scorpion is too slow to outrun most starfighters.",
