More ships in wedge-design followed during the era of the Empire, such as the famous Imperial-class Star Destroyers or Sienar Fleet Systems Interdictor-class Cruiser. Another one of the ships with this typical design is the Broadcast-class Communications ship, built by Kuat Drive Yards. It is an older ship type which was first introduced shortly after the release of the Imperial Star Destroyer Mk. I.<br />The communication ship's role within a fleet is important. Transmissions from Fleet Command to the fleet are brought through the communications ship and the other way round, when a fleet is acting far away from the sector command. But the ship's large sensor array also enables it to detect enemy activity long before this can detect the fleet. This tactical advantage is an important part for a successful operation. Most of the ship's interior is used for the sensitive communications technology. Furthermore, the ship supports quick and clear transmission among ships in the fleet, although it stays in a safe distance since it isn't primarily a combat vessel. The ship does have some Turbolasers and Twin-Lasers for defense, however, as well as a squadron of TIE fighters for additional protection.",
